      <description>A few days ago I had the opportunity and the privilege to deliver three different talks, in three consecutive days, in two international events: Big Things Conference 2019 and Commit Conf 2019. This crazy coincidence forces me to write one single post to summarize my experience in both events, including an overview of my three talks.
Taking advantage of this, I have also created a new section on this website to publish the main public talks that I&#39;m proudly giving.</description>

      <description>Greach 2019   This week I could attend another fantastic Greach Conference, an international conference that in previous years was focused on the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem (Grails, Gradle, etc.) but this year has expanded the scope to other technologies related to the JVM like Micronaut, GraalVM, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Android, &amp;hellip;
Greach is a non-profitable event held in Madrid since 2011 (I think I&#39;ve missed only one edition).</description>

      <description>My Saturday finished having a great dinner with friends and lots of laughs in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels.
 FOSDEM 2019 poster   As usual, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early. Lot&#39;s of things to see in a complete set of new devrooms/tracks. This year I focused my second day in the Community and Geospatial devrooms.
Before continuing, if you want to read my summary of the previous day you can follow this link: FOSDEM 2019: Saturday.</description>

      <description>It has been a week since I returned from another intense and thought-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. This year, apart from attending FOSDEM (as I intend to do every year) I took a very early flight on Friday to visit new (for me) places in the city. In just one day I visited the European Parliament Hemicycle, the House of European History, the Parlamentarium and the Museum of Natural Sciences.</description>

      <description>Greach 2018   Some days ago I attended as usual to the fantastic Greach Conference, an international conference about the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem: Groovy, Grails, Gradle and a lot other things. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it&#39;s surely one of the Top worldwide events about this technologies.
Greach is a non-profitable event organized by Iván López (@ilopar) and Alberto Vilches (@albertovilches), with some help from colleagues and a lot of sponsors.</description>

      <description>After an interesting Saturday, finished with a great dinner with some friends in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early.
My choices for the Sunday were again diverse and (in most cases) successful. Apart from the closing keynotes, I spent some time in the Legal and Policy Issues devroom, a couple of talks in the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science devroom and half the afternoon in the Geospatial devroom.</description>

      <description>After an uncertain landing a few hours ago (the airport in Madrid was barely working due to a snowy morning), I&#39;ve just arrived home but instead of having some rest after an intense and though-provoking FOSDEM I felt the urge to start writing about my weekend in Brussels.
I&#39;ve been there not only to enjoy this wonderful city with its trappist beers and great food, but specially to attend FOSDEM as I intend to do every year.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago DZone published an article called 9 Things Java Programmers Should Learn in 2018. I liked the idea and I even recommended the article to a couple of colleagues who are trying to reorient their professional career. After the advice I added some personal disclaimers about the content, to the point that one of my friends wisely told me:
&amp;hellip;and that brought us here :-)
The article in DZone is fine and very detailed with good recommendations but it&#39;s not realistic.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended Big Data Spain (BDS), a renowned event focused particularly on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It&#39;s a reference event about Big Data, not only in Spain but across Europe. The event is almost entirely held in English and attracts top level speakers and public.
I couldn&#39;t take a lot of notes, but I&#39;ll summarize the talks that deserve your attention (among those that I heard):</description>

      <description>For many different reasons I have had to discuss quite a lot recently about the professionalism of some people, technical and non-technical. Sometimes, because a person feels that she (I will use the feminine as neutral gender) is not being treated fairly with respect of her category, or because her performance is disappointing for others, sometimes after unfair comparisons between colleagues, &amp;hellip; As a common element, a diabolical concept was almost always being misused in these situations: Seniority.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the huge pleasure to participate in a week-long Security Summer Camp organized by the Information Security department of ING Spain. The agenda was very promising and implied some theory and lots of practice, ending with an Escape the Room game and a 2,5 days long Capture The Flag hacking competition. Several speakers from the Infosec Squad prepared talks and workshops about different topics, focusing on Ethical Hacking, secure development, server hardening or OSINT.</description>

      <description>Almost since I created my personal blog in 2003 I thought about moving it from blogger to my own domain, private hosting and so on. My laziness prevented me from doing so. Not because the migration itself, but for the maintenance it entailed.
Anyhow, I was determined to migrate my blog outside of any blogging platform. I wanted to have complete control over my content, but without wasting lots of time in maintenance.</description>

 Greach Conference 2017   This week I attended, as usual since I don&#39;t remember when, to Greach 2017, an international conference about the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it&#39;s probably one of the Top3 worldwide events about this technology.</description>

      <description>Para mantener la buena costumbre (ya, lo sé, no siempre cumplo), voy a relatar brevemente mi experiencia durante Codemotion 2016, uno de los eventos sobre informática y programación más importantes del país. No hay números oficiales definitivos pero en la clausura la organización comentó que hubo más de 2.000 asistentes y más de 150 charlas/talleres. Suelo asistir todos los años, hay otros eventos más potentes e interesantes para tecnologías concretas pero como evento generalista donde puedes ver y oír de todo creo que Codemotion hoy en día no tiene rival (al menos en España).</description>

 FOSDEM 2016   You can read about the rest of my FOSDEM here:
FOSDEM 2016: Friday FOSDEM 2016: Saturday  As a retrospective, I attended a lot of talks and almost all of them were very interesting, but looking back now I realize that I should&#39;ve spent more time in the stands and aisles.</description>

 FOSDEM 2016   After an interesting Friday (as I told you yesterday) our FOSDEM Saturday started early. I attended a couple of talks in the Free Java DevRoom, another couple about Open Source Design but surprisingly most of them were in the Legal and Policy Issues track.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I attended FOSDEM in Brussels last January. I should have written this weeks ago but better late than ever, right?
 FOSDEM 2016   As you may know if you are reading this, FOSDEM is a not to be missed event about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). By far, it is the most important gathering about FOSS in the planet. It&#39;s an unbeatable opportunity to attend great talks and workshops, but also to hang around with amazing people and top professionals.</description>

Esta iniciativa consiste en permitir cada seis meses que durante una semana completa todos los empleados de la empresa organicen y participen en proyectos totalmente personales (suyos o de otro compañero).</description>

      <description>Por fin saco un rato, con un mes de retraso, para hablar del evento Spring I/O 2012. A estas alturas lo fácil habría sido dejarlo estar, pero en mi empresa me han recordado que por algo me &#34;designaron&#34; como representante y autorizaron mi asistencia. Como primer paso para compartir lo vivido con mis compañeros (en forma de presentación si sacase tiempo), dejaré aquí un resumen de las notas que tomé.</description>
