<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this yearly post I used to include a graph with the games played by month, but it turned more or less complex and meaningless as the trend was clear year by year. I tend to play more or less the same along the year with some peaks in the gaming conventions.</li>
<li>In 2018 I went back to the 2016 numbers in amount of plays, with a higher amount of different games played.</li>
<li>I've played 61 different games this year, 41 of them were totally new (to me). A very high proportion.</li>
<li>I recorded 43 gaming sessions, almost 4 per month.</li>
<li>Again, in 2018 I have <strong>zero</strong> hours recorded in the Steam platform. I miss it and I will give it some priority in 2019.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is still at <b>11</b>. Reading carefully the data, I expect to go up at least one level in the next period, as I have several games near the h-index frontier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<ul>
<li>I still enjoy a lot playing boardgames, role playing games and video games so I will keep this as one of my main leisure activities for 2019</li>
<li>In January 2018 we finished <a href="https://rpggeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic Legacy Season 1</a> the campaign we started back in 2016, but after that I haven't played any other legacy game. I still love cooperative games and I would not reject starting one with a stable playing group, maybe the recently announced <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2019/1/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-middle-earth/"><strong>Journeys in the Middle Earth</strong></a>?</li>
<li>I am becoming addicted to <strong>escape room inspired board games</strong>. In 2018 I have played several <a href="https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/39442/unlock">Unlock!</a> and <a href="https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/36963/exit-das-spiel">Exit</a> and for 2019 my goal is to play all the published games of those two families</li>
<li>I managed (with my party and DM) to maintain since March a monthly <a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</strong></a> campaign, and I only missed one session because of a trip. That is very good news for me and for the entire group, we are <a href="http://ghilbrae.com/tag/storm-kings-thunder/">enjoying it a lot</a> so we will hopefully continue with the same frequency and passion.</li>
<li>I'm still eager to play prototypes, but since early 2018 I am no longer a member of <a href="http://www.asociacionludo.com/"><strong>Asociación Ludo</strong></a>. I was not involved at all so, although I miss some of my colleagues there, I decided to leave after realizing that the association does not benefit from me if I'm only providing economic support. I will consider returning when I'm capable of offering more :-(</li>
