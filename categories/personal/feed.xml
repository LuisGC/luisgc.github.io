      <description>Disclaimer: Out of necessity, this entry will be shorter than I would like (although it may not seem so) and in Spanish, despite more than 90% of my readers (according to Google Analytics) do not have Spanish as their main language. For the first time I managed to take notes during the trip and I had to limit myself to transcribe those notes.
Nunca había visitado Asia y llevaba años con esa espinita clavada.</description>

      <description>Showing off my double nationality - CC License   If you are reading this you probably know already that I am a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, to the point that I joined the Spanish Tolkien Society (Sociedad Tolkien Española) almost 20 years ago and I usually don&amp;rsquo;t miss any of their events.
Since recently I also belong to the Tolkien Society, and after having missed for probably important (but now forgotten) reasons Tolkien 2005 and Tolkien 2012, the last major events that they organized, I was not going to miss Tolkien 2019.</description>

      <description>My Saturday finished having a great dinner with friends and lots of laughs in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels.
 FOSDEM 2019 poster   As usual, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early. Lot&amp;rsquo;s of things to see in a complete set of new devrooms/tracks. This year I focused my second day in the Community and Geospatial devrooms.
Before continuing, if you want to read my summary of the previous day you can follow this link: FOSDEM 2019: Saturday.</description>

      <description>It has been a week since I returned from another intense and thought-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. This year, apart from attending FOSDEM (as I intend to do every year) I took a very early flight on Friday to visit new (for me) places in the city. In just one day I visited the European Parliament Hemicycle, the House of European History, the Parlamentarium and the Museum of Natural Sciences.</description>

      <description>Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the previous year. I have been doing this since 2011 in Spanish, but this time I will do it in English as with the rest of my posts. You can read about my previous years (in Spanish):
 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011  Evolution of my game plays over the last years   2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Total since 2006   Total amount of plays 101 84 98 84 81 117 161 952   Different games played 61 72 55 71 52 81 80 356   Games with 2 or more plays (in the year) 14 9 15 13 14 19 40 161   Amount of gaming sessions 43 36 35 30 44 41 36 322    Games played per year until the end of 2018   Analysis  In this yearly post I used to include a graph with the games played by month, but it turned more or less complex and meaningless as the trend was clear year by year.</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend Agatha, this time through the German Romantische Strasse. It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through Scotland, Austria, Brittany or Normandy (and we have made a few more).
I&amp;rsquo;m adding the German adjective to the title because last year I also traveled through the Austrian Romantikstrasse.</description>

      <description>I was eager to introduce this section on this site for a long time, after seeing it on my favorite travel blog: Dendarii.es, written by my dearest Yami. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s about travels since I enjoy more and more traveling and reviewing my trips.
My Curriculum Vitae as a traveler contains two main parts:
 A Leaflet map with all my visited countries with a link to the review that I could have written here in the blog.</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make an awesome road trip through Scotland with my friend Agatha, my travel companion lately. You can read about our trips together through Austria, Brittany or Normandy.
It was my second time in Scotland, after a great trip three years ago to visit mainly Edinburgh. So, this time the Scottish capital was discarded as a destination and the goal was to visit as much as possible of the rest of this beautiful country.</description>

      <description>After an interesting Saturday, finished with a great dinner with some friends in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early.
FOSDEM 2018  My choices for the Sunday were again diverse and (in most cases) successful. Apart from the closing keynotes, I spent some time in the Legal and Policy Issues devroom, a couple of talks in the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science devroom and half the afternoon in the Geospatial devroom.</description>

      <description>After an uncertain landing a few hours ago (the airport in Madrid was barely working due to a snowy morning), I&amp;rsquo;ve just arrived home but instead of having some rest after an intense and though-provoking FOSDEM I felt the urge to start writing about my weekend in Brussels.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been there not only to enjoy this wonderful city with its trappist beers and great food, but specially to attend FOSDEM as I intend to do every year.</description>

      <description>As explained in the previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been in Normandy and Brittany with my friend Agatha. After publishing the first part of the trip (Normandy: a brief opinionated guide) now I proceed to do the same with Brittany.
It has been quite complicated because we saw a lot of awesome things and for me it still takes a lot of time (several hours) to write this kind of articles.</description>

      <description>Some months ago I wrote in the blog about my road trip through the Romantikstraße in Austria. I shared the trip with Agatha and it went great, so we took advantage of the fact that we both had several pending holidays for this year and repeated the experience in two of the most beautiful regions in France: Normandy and Brittany. This post will be a summary of our experience in Normandy and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write a similar one for Brittany.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the huge pleasure to participate in a week-long Security Summer Camp organized by the Information Security department of ING Spain. The agenda was very promising and implied some theory and lots of practice, ending with an Escape the Room game and a 2,5 days long Capture The Flag hacking competition. Several speakers from the Infosec Squad prepared talks and workshops about different topics, focusing on Ethical Hacking, secure development, server hardening or OSINT.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of making a road trip through Austria following what they call the Romantikstraße, Romantic Road or Romantic Trail in English. Interestingly, ours was a singles trip initially planned for three friends but sadly in the end we were only two because at the last minute Roberto had to cancel. I shared this great adventure only with Agatha and it was great (as expected).</description>

 FOSDEM 2016   As you may know if you are reading this, FOSDEM is a not to be missed event about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). By far, it is the most important gathering about FOSS in the planet. It&#39;s an unbeatable opportunity to attend great talks and workshops, but also to hang around with amazing people and top professionals.</description>

      <description>El próximo Sábado 16 de Marzo vuelve Escépticos en el Pub Madrid, con un tema que esperamos genere un buen debate, con un sano e interesante intercambio de opiniones.
La charla será impartida por Almudena Martínez, humanista y sexóloga, y Montse Ibañez, matemática. Cuentan que se conocieron en un curso sobre sexualidad humana, y desde entonces vienen definiendo lo que consideran una visión novedosa sobre el erotismo y la sexualidad.</description>

      <description>(Entrada publicada también en el blog de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica)  Dentro de tres días, el próximo Miércoles 30 de Enero, estaré en Ginebra para una visita que llevo mucho tiempo planeando: la Organización Europea para la Investigación Nuclear que todos conocemos por sus siglas en francés CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire).
Tras una introducción para despistados (muy despistados) entraré al propósito de esta entrada, una guía rápida y fácil para visitar el CERN, dado que es mucho más sencillo y asequible de lo que la gente cree.</description>

      <description>Algunos recordaréis (y los que no, ya lo sabéis) que en Julio del pasado año tuve el placer de participar en la PiWeek (Personal Innovation Week), una iniciativa muy interesante por parte de Kaleidos (una empresa madrileña orientada al software libre con la que tengo únótimë lazos). Esta iniciativa consiste en permitir cada seis meses que durante una semana completa todos los empleados de la empresa organicen y participen en proyectos totalmente personales (suyos o de otro compañero).</description>

      <description>Repito la entrada que publiqué hace ahora un año con datos sobre las partidas que jugué en 2011. Generó entre bastantes lectores comentarios y mucha curiosidad por algunos juegos. En esta ocasión puedo además comparar con los datos del año anterior, y no he podido resistir la tentación de crear una nueva nube ponderada de tags.
Me he acostumbrado perfectamente a registrar en Board Game Geek todas las partidas según las estoy jugando, resulta muy cómodo y rápido con su aplicación para Android.</description>

      <description>Se termina 2012. Consumo las últimas horas y creo que puedo decir que he agotado al máximo el año. Para lo bueno y para lo malo.
He tenido a menudo la intención (imposible de cumplir) de escribir una larga entrada con cada cosa relevante que hice durante el año. En lugar de eso tengo unas pocas entradas con convocatorias y breves reseñas. Muchos me lo echáis en cara (con razón).</description>

En estos momentos estoy en un tren camino de Washington a Nueva York, probablemente leyendo o durmiendo, pero la magia de la informática me permite contaros qué tengo pensado hacer este próximo fin de semana. La excusa para este viaje de 10 días por los Estados Unidos es que tengo la intención de participar en la próxima NECSS 2012 (Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism), que se celebra aquí en la Gran Manzana el 21 y 22 de Abril.</description>

Siento no haber sacado tiempo (a nadie le sorprenderá) para una entrada más elaborada, lo cierto es que tengo comprada la entrada, el vuelo y la habitación de hotel desde hace varios meses.
QED (Question-Explore-Discover) es un maravilloso evento organizado por Greater Manchester Skeptics Society y Merseyside Skeptics Society.</description>

      <description>Este año he jugado mucho y a muchos juegos, tantos que apenas en algunos he repetido más de 2-3 veces. Como catalogador obsesivo y compulsivo tengo las cifras más o menos exactas gracias a Board Game Geek y su fantástica aplicación para Android.
Plan para la Nochevieja 2011
Source: My own pictures - CC BY-NC-SA  Paso directamente al resumen de las cifras. He jugado 164 partidas a 71 juegos diferentes, considerando que a 39 de ellos sólo jugué una única vez.</description>

En esta ocasión se trata de narrar los hechos acontecidos desde que se realizó el pedido en el pasado mes de Julio hasta hoy. Todos ustedes deberían conocer la tira cómica de XKCD, y si no es así pulsen Alt-F4 en este momento. No me detendré en ello.</description>

Será un placer por motivos evidentes, disfrutaré tremendamente de las charlas aunque alguno de los ponentes suele activar a menudo mi detector de chorradas. Además en este caso será un honor por haber sido invitado a asistir gracias a mi pertenencia a ARP Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico.</description>

      <description>Aprovechando que acabo de realizar mi undécimo préstamo a través de Kiva vuelvo a hablaros un poco de este servicio. Hace ahora poco más de un año que os hablé de ello por primera vez, fue más o menos entonces cuando realicé mi primer préstamo a través de esta web. Luego han llegado 10 préstamos más, con los que llevo prestados exactamente 275 dólares (incluyendo todo lo que me han ido devolviendo) a gente que los necesita mucho más que yo.</description>

El motivo de este viaje es asistir a la TAM London 2010, un evento único y muy especial. TAM viene de ‘The Amaz!ng Meeting’, unas jornadas de eventos y conferencias organizadas por la JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation) habitualmente en Las Vegas aunque desde 2009 se vienen desdoblando aquí en Europa, en Londres hasta ahora.</description>

Kiva es una organización sin ánimo de lucro, y su misión es facilitar la llegada de capital del primer al tercer mundo a través de organizaciones locales de cada país. Tal y como dice su web, Kiva nació con las siguientes creencias:</description>

El camión-grúa venía en dirección opuesta a la mía, a bastante velocidad, y con la pluma levantada sin darse cuenta. El choque contra el puente ha sido bestial, el camión levantó el morro bastante y terminó volcando hacia su derecha (según el sentido de su marcha) derramando varios palés de ladrillos.</description>

Vuelvo a llevar conmigo al ínclito Finceleb, que ya me acompañó el año pasado al Descenso del Sella. La explosión aquel día de un artefacto terrorista a pocos metros de nosotros no le ha desanimado. Habrá ayudado el hecho de que nos pilló jugando a las palas en la playa junto a dos cajas de sidra XDD.</description>

La ciudad es ciertamente bonita, pero es el ambiente lo que me hace volver de cuando en cuando. Tanto, que un día que vuelva tendré que plantearme dejarme de paseos y entrar a visitar los edificios importantes y museos, que tras muchas visitas aún desconozco.</description>

Este fin de semana he cumplido varios de mis deseos, disfrutar de un fabuloso fin de semana en Jerez, hacerlo durante un Gran Premio de Motociclismo, ver Sevilla, conocer más el Sur y encontrar gente estupenda.
Salimos de Madrid el Viernes muy temprano, y llegamos a comer a Sevilla.</description>
