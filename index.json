    "body": "Due to the pandemic this year I could not make my yearly pilgrimage to Brussels, but I was still able to attend FOSDEM as it mutated to an online conference for the first time. It has not been the same, but it is still an experience I cannot miss.\nFor those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know FOSDEM, I will keep my usual description. It is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to Open Source development and communities. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) ecosystem. It\u0026rsquo;s also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with names and faces you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.\nBeing online, this year the interaction was limited to Matrix and IRC Freenode channels in parallel to the live streaming, and Jitsi for the streaming. Everything is open source, and scaled amazingly.\nAs @fosdem regulars we are really excited our software is used to facilitate this year\u0026#39;s uncoventional edition. Kudos to all organizers! 🚀\n\u0026mdash; Jitsi (@jitsinews) February 6, 2021  I already wrote about it in previous years:\n FOSDEM 2016: Friday, Saturday and Sunday FOSDEM 2018: Saturday and Sunday FOSDEM 2019: Saturday and Sunday FOSDEM 2020: Saturday and Sunday  The numbers of this 2021 edition are slightly lower than in 2020 in terms of content, but it\u0026rsquo;s amazing they could almost maintain the volume of activities and this time reaching to a worldwide audience:\n 682 speakers in 773 different events (talks or workshops, mainly) 51 different devrooms hundreds of hours of content, almost all of the events are available online with live streaming during the conference 52 online stands of all kinds of projects: FSFE, the Apache Software Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, Fedora, Debian KDE, Gnome, LibreOffice, Jenkins, \u0026hellip;  To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is organized by volunteers, everything is community driven and it\u0026rsquo;s free to attend. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to register beforehand.\nAs usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):\nTalks Getting the Most from Modern Java, by Simon Ritter (@speakjava)\nSimon Ritter gave an overview of the most recent updates in the Java language: better switch statements in JDK 12, a preview of the text blocks for JDK 13, simpler Data classes and Records in JDK 14, sealed classes in JDK 15, more on Records, pattern matching and sealed classes in JDK 16\u0026hellip;\nOverall a good overview by Simon, as usual. I lost the count of his talks that I have attended.\n10 Ways Everyone Can Support the Java Community, by Stephen Chin (@steveonjava)\nAnother popular speaker to explain different ways to support Java, not only with coding. Some of the ideas were:\n Contribute to OpenJDK: Find something interesting, discuss your intended changed and finally submit a patch Join the Foojay community, a new online community for friends of OpenJDK Join or sponsor a Java Users Group, you can find JUGs almost everywhere although now most of them are online. Even before the pandemic you could already find a few virtual JUGs. Follow a Java Champion in twitter (I just checked and I\u0026rsquo;m following almost 20). Join a specialized Slack channel, write articles in your blog, participate in an unconference event, \u0026hellip;  The Death of Openness and Freedom?, by Matt Yonkovit (@MYonkovit)\nMatt reflects on how the huge success of Open Source also brought imitators, as in another sectors like sci-fi movies. But success in Open Source has different implications, depending on the project. Matt also comments in the recent problems that we have seen in different communities, from more or less embarrassing licensing changes to projects moved to \u0026ldquo;as a service\u0026rdquo; exclusive business models.\nThe talk is a good overview of the different models, advantages and disadvantages of them. A thought provoking talk with lots of interesting insights.\nThe Democratization of Databases, by Bruce Momjian\nBruce started with an overview of what democracy or representative democracy means, and the specific advantages of other systems like an autocracy might have in sectors like the military or the space exploration. Software is usually better under democracy as it allows rapid adjustment of goals and expands the pool of talent.\nAccording to the speaker, Democracy in open source works a bit differently. It is a mix of democracy and meritocracy, where voting can be problematic but bad decisions can quickly be reverted. The main drawback is that the plan or road map is not reliable.\nFinally, the talk focuses on the PostgreSQL community, and how they operate and evolve.\nMozilla History: 20+ Years And Counting, by Robert Kaiser\nNice summary of all the important milestones of Mozilla by KaiRo. Lots of nice memories:\n the origin of the name (mixing Mosaic and Godzilla as in Mosaic Killer), that was later renamed to Netscape How the Firefox web browser was born How the Mozilla Foundation started, alongside the Mozilla Corporation The Mozilla Manifesto, written in 2007 Rust, Firefox OS, Mozilla Hubs and many other things\u0026hellip;  Database Performance at GitLab.com by Nikolay Samokhvalov and Jose Finotto\nInteresting overview about how Gitlab copes with their massive amounts of users and their strict SLAs, focusing specially in the PostgreSQL database side. I got several interesting inputs from the talk, from automated database health checks (and how they do them), to best practices for the engineers (how they learn and get insights of their usage), how they experiment using thin clones, etc.\n25 years of MySQL - A Retrospective, by Dave Stokes (@stoker)\nDave Stoker, community manager at MySQL, gave an historical overview of MySQL since its beginning.\nWe start with @stoker ! 25 years of @MySQL #FOSDEM2021 #MySQL #mysqldevroom https://t.co/yC4A7gWOwt pic.twitter.com/J15LDat4EO\n\u0026mdash; lefred (@lefred) February 7, 2021  It was a nice presentation, with the sense of humor you expect in this nostalgic exercises.\nTelegram Bot For Navigation, by Ilya Zverev (@ilyazver)\nI have attended several talks by Ilya, some of them online and others here in FOSDEM. He always deliver insightful content, this time focused on how to provide navigation capabilities without relying on a map or a web. Ilya explained that he moved a few years ago to a neighborhood with little data mapped in OpenStreetMap. Instead of mapping all the different venues/places surrounding him individually, he tried another approach. He built his own Telegram bot, first to search for venues and then to add new places.\nThe main missing part is that the data surveyed using the tool is not being loaded or synchronized with OSM. Hopefully he will include it in the bot roadmap soon.\nMaking Documentation a First-class Citizen in Open Source Projects, by Ray Paik and Sofia Wallin\nRay and Sofia analyzed the problems that we usually see in open source documentation: lack of consistency mainly. They also explained how a few years ago a cross community group was created with the goal to provide a common way for documentation handling in the LF Networking project.\nThey gave also several recommendations, for example:\n Include the Documentation as part of your definition of done, being a key part of your product/project Keep the documentation where your code is Keep an \u0026ldquo;edit this page\u0026rdquo; button or equivalent to make contributions easier. This is key during on-boarding processes or just to lower the entry barrier Recognize contributions, organize documentation specific events  Mental health and free software, by Brendan Abolivier (@BrenAbolivier)\nThis topic is very delicate, and this is part of the problem. As Brendan explained in the presentation, mental health should not be a taboo. The speaker also added the disclaimer that this is not a specific issue of Free Software, but he focused the talk on this based on his experience.\nFree Software usually implies a strong interaction with a community. This sometimes implies staying up late to close an argument or to finish up a pull request, putting a lot of pressure on this. The speaker argues that it can be worse in FOSS compared to other sectors because the emotional aspect is much more important, and everything is happening in public places. On addition to this, joining a big FOSS project also implies a bigger public space and an additional difficulty to take the initiative.\nHe closed the session with different ways to mitigate the problem depending on your role in a certain moment: maintainer, contributor, employer/manager, etc. The overall recommendation is to try self-care activities, to be generous with your personal time, to be gentle with yourself and to reach a therapist if needed.\nOpen Source is More Than Just a License, by Don Goodman-Wilson (@DEGoodmanWilson)\nThe speaker reflects on the differences between the colloquial and institutional descriptions of Open Source, after a few projects have claimed they are open source although they are not. This is partially caused on the emphasized importance of the license over other factors.\nAccording to the speaker, focusing Open Source in just licenses is only necessary when you only want to to mitigate risk management or to reduce costs. Open source should be more about collaboration, openness to participation, pursuing goals that are community-driven, etc. Choosing one license or another should be just a mean to an end, not the end itself.\nThe speaker proposes using a Ethical Source Definition for software, that summarizes in:\n Benefits the Commons, meaning that it can be distributed freely and anyone can use or modify the software Created in the Open, developed in public view and accepting public contributions Welcoming and Just Community. Clear rules of governance need to be published and enforced Puts Accessibility First. It needs to be available to everybody Prioritizes User Safety Protects User Privacy Encourages Fair Compensation  In summary: licenses are important and useful, but put your community first\nPenpot, design freedom for teams, by Pablo Ruiz (@diacritica)\nPenpot was presented in FOSDEM last year (as UXBOX, its previous name), and one year later Pablo is back in FOSDEM to announce the alpha version. As he did last year, he starts the presentation explaining why they came up with this, and how they discovered they could not find a suitable open and free tool so they managed to create an outstanding one.\nThen, he directly started a commented demo using Penpot to re-design the FOSDEM website. It was amazing to see the current maturity of the tool. He completed the demo explaining some integrations they are working on between Penpot and Taiga, taking advantage of the fact that they are the creators and core developers of both tools.\n Pablo Ruiz presenting Penpot in FOSDEM 2021   And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you (hopefully in Brussels) in FOSDEM 2022!!\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the last year. You can read about my previous years:\n 2019 2018 2017 (in Spanish) 2016 (in Spanish) 2015 (in Spanish) 2014 (in Spanish) 2013 (in Spanish) 2012 (in Spanish) 2011 (in Spanish)  Data     2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 \u0026hellip; Total since 2006     Total amount of plays 88 73 101 84 98  1222   Different games played 21 33 61 72 55  440   Games with 2 or more plays 9 9 14 9 15  190   Amount of gaming sessions 62 37 43 36 35  464    Evolution of my boardgame plays over the last 5 years  Games played per year until the end of 2020   Retrospective I will organize again the analysis in categories, as the time I spent in RPG or video games is becoming much more relevant.\nBoardgames  In 2020 I have played more than in the previous years, and mainly to long games. I recorded 62 gaming sessions, more than 5 per month, to just 20 different games. My h-index as a player is now 12. I expected to raise it this year, as I have played intensively to a few games. I have played 48 scenarios of Gloomhaven in 41 sessions. That is more than half the games I\u0026rsquo;ve played in the whole year. I love it, and perhaps I should write a spoiler free post in the blog about it.  Role-playing games  With just 8 sessions, mostly online due to the pandemic, we closed in June our Storm King\u0026rsquo;s Thunder campaign for Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th Edition. For the moment, we haven\u0026rsquo;t started a new campaign, with D\u0026amp;D or not, but I hope we will be able to do it as soon as the situation allows it.  Video games  This year I have played more video games than ever, for sure. In Steam I have played:  Mostly Tabletop Simulator. I have more than 150h only from 2020. I played for a while to This War of Mine. Interesting and challenging, I will probably play again when in the proper mood. I finished Firewatch. An intense and well written story. Some passages ended up being too repetitive but the game is short overall. I completed The Darkside Detective. Interesting and challenging puzzles, good laughs with a nice design and a fantastic retro based characters and stories.   In January I bought a second hand Playstation 4 from a colleague (without knowing about covid-19 yet) and since April I used it a lot. I have completed:  Marvel\u0026rsquo;s Spiderman. The positive things make the negative ones irrelevant. It\u0026rsquo;s just awesome to swing around Manhattan and I spent hours just doing it. Journey. Cute and short game, and both things deserve recognition sometimes. Perhaps too short but take it or leave it. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Dozens of hours, my favourite game so far. Some side quests are repetitive but in general I engaged a lot with the character. Being a huge fan of the novels also helps, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a requirement to enjoy the game. I played Witcher 1 and 2 just to play this, and it was totally worth it. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection, including Uncharted: Drake\u0026rsquo;s Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake\u0026rsquo;s Deception. Being a completists, I need to play (if I can) all the saga. After having played (and loved) several Tomb Raider games, this was a perfect match for me and I was not disappointed. Call of Duty: Black Ops III. I only played the campaign, only single player and no zombie scenarios. Having said that, I liked it and perhaps I could play it again. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. I enjoyed the spaceship missions and the overall campaign story, but as I played it just after Black Ops III, it was too repetitive sometimes. Mass Effect: Andromeda. My first interaction with Mass Effect, and I liked it a lot. Dozens of hours to avoid leaving any single rock unturned, and it was worth it. Dragon Age Inquisition. My first interaction with Dragon Age, and it is not going to be the last one. It reminded me sometimes to Pillars of Eternity and Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate, but the story is perhaps more solid and the overall atmosphere is more dramatic. The only thing that I disliked was all the gear evolution related parts, it was confusing and often useless.   Despite having a new PlayStation, I have tried to play in Stadia as well, as a PRO subscriber. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used the subscription so I finally cancelled it. In 2020 I played.  Destiny 2, I like the game and I\u0026rsquo;ve spent several hours but I haven\u0026rsquo;t engaged yet with it. Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year celebration. Only with the opening scene I know I will play it again in the future. It\u0026rsquo;s probably my favorite Tomb Raider game and I love all of them. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. I bought it with a discount without removing my subscription as it looked like an Uncharted game in the Star Wars universe, and it\u0026rsquo;s more or less like this. I enjoyed being a Jedi and learning to be one, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the lack of fast travel. Exploration it\u0026rsquo;s a big part of the game, and it\u0026rsquo;s nice and challenging, but once you get lost in a labyrinth a few times it starts to piss you off. The end is awesome, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. Either on Steam, PS4 or Stadia, I plan to keep playing as much as I can also this year. Perhaps eventually in PS5, who knows?    ",

    "body": "Disclaimer: Out of necessity, this entry will be shorter than I would like and in Spanish, despite most of my readers (according to Google Analytics) do not have Spanish as their main language.\nNo pude asistir a la anterior edición de esLibre en Granada (a pesar de que lo tenía previsto inicialmente) pero en ningún caso me quería perder el evento de 2020. Tanto es así que presenté una propuesta de charla incluso :-)\n logo del Congreso esLibre 2020   El Congreso esLibre está pensado para cualquier persona interesada en la tecnología y la cultura libres, ideal para compartir conocimiento y experiencias alrededor de las mismas. En cierto modo, recupera el espíritu y los contenidos de los congresos Hispalinux a los que yo solía asistir con mis compañeros de facultad. Por otro lado, es clara e innegable la influencia de FOSDEM, el evento de referencia sobre FLOSS del que os he hablado varias veces (en inglés) en el blog:\n FOSDEM 2016: Viernes, Sábado y Domingo FOSDEM 2018: Sábado y Domingo FOSDEM 2019: Sábado y Domingo FOSDEM 2020: Sábado y Domingo  El evento de este año, coordinado por la OfiLibre de la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos estaba previsto inicialmente para primeros de Junio y se celebraría en el campus de la propia URJC (ya no recuerdo si en la ETSII de Móstoles o la ETSIT de Fuenlabrada). Debido a la llegada de una pandemia mundial de la que habréis oído hablar, el evento fue primero aplazado indefinidamente para poco después convocarse de nuevo para celebrarse íntegramente online del 18 al 19 de Septiembre. Por suerte las nuevas fechas permitieron que pudiera cumplir mi doble propósito de asistir e impartir la charla que me aceptaron.\nEl Congreso esLibre 2020 fue montado y organizado por voluntarios utilizando tecnologías libres: principalmente BigBlueButton para compartir las charlas, Rocket.Chat para comentar de forma organizada cada ponencia y ofrecer/conseguir ayuda; y Mozilla Hubs para el encuentro más social tras las charlas del primer día. Yo mismo me dejé engañar para moderar uno de los slots de charlas.\nVoy a resumir un poco algunas de las charlas a las que pude asistir (en orden cronológico):\nCharlas Software Heritage: Una Infraestructura común para preservar nuestro software comunitario, por Roberto Di Cosmo (@rdicosmo)\nSoftware Heritage, que en 2016 co-fundó y desde entonces dirige el ponente, es una fantástica iniciativa sin ánimo de lucro destinada a preservar la mayor parte posible de código fuente de cualquier proyecto. Desde hace muchos años, y cada vez más, el código fuente es también un reflejo de nuestra cultura y nuestras costumbres.\nEntre sus objetivos, además de recopilar y preservar, también está compartir. Pretende ser una plataforma ideal para revisar, comentar y enlazar fragmentos de código. Ahora mismo alberga más de 142 millones de proyectos, entre otros una copia (no actualizada) de este mismo blog.\nAdemás del factor cultural, el proyecto tiene interesantes implicaciones desde el punto de vista educativo y de investigación. Solo los aspectos técnicos de un proyecto así ya darían para unas cuantas charlas. Revisaré la documentación para saciar mi curiosidad.\nEsta keynote fue una fantástica charla de apertura para un congreso como este.\nYes, source code is special: it\u0026#39;s executable knowledge that is meant to be human readable, by design. It\u0026#39;s an all time new in human history.\n\u0026mdash; Roberto Di Cosmo (@rdicosmo) February 18, 2016  Sobre la gobernanza en lenguajes de programación, por un servidor\nPero madruga un poco más y empieza conociendo de la mano de @luiyo un poco más sobre los modelos de gobernanza en la evolución de distintos lenguajes de progrramación - https://t.co/onNqcTW3KS\n\u0026mdash; David Gómez G. | @dgomezg@jvm.social (@dgomezg) September 17, 2020  Me encanta esta charla. Prepararla me lleva muchísimo tiempo pero disfruto cada minuto. No me cansaré de actualizarla y repetirla siempre que perciba que sigue siendo relevante y bien recibida. Por el feedback que obtengo cada vez, diría que a la gente también le gusta mucho. En cualquier caso no espero repetirla en bastante tiempo, salvo que tenga claro que la audiencia es claramente nueva.\nEs una charla compleja de preparar y muy difícil de contar. Normalmente la hago bastante interactiva pero en esta ocasión siendo online y teniendo sólo 20 minutos el desafío era importante. Omitiendo unas cuantas slides, mencionando sólo lo más importante y hablando extremadamente rápido conseguí que me sobrasen incluso algunos segundos.\nSobre la charla en sí, ya comenté más detalles sobre ella cuando la impartí el año pasado en Commit Conf. El propósito (que espero lograr) es llamar a la reflexión sobre los aspectos más relativos a la ética y menos a la tecnología que son importantes en relación a la gobernanza y comunidad de un lenguaje de programación. Creo que todos deberíamos conocer y tener en cuenta este tipo de factores a la hora de elegir un lenguaje para nuestro nuevo proyecto (especialmente si es abierto). Como siempre que actualizo la charla, investigué a fondo los entresijos de varios lenguajes y comunidades para poder destacar lo más reciente o importante en relación a los aspectos éticos de dichos lenguajes o comunidades.\nCuando se publique el vídeo podéis incluso ver ambas charlas porque siendo la misma estructura el contenido cambia bastante.\n En el turno de preguntas de mi charla en esLibre 2020   Enseñando informática en 2020: una propuesta basada en el software libre, por JJ Merelo\nEsta charla de JJ me pareció muy interesante, y me hizo preguntarme si deberíamos aplicar el concepto a otros ámbitos.\nLa premisa del ponente es aplicar a la evaluación y seguimiento en la enseñanza, en este caso específico para la carrera de Informática donde se presuponen ciertos conocimientos, los mismos sistemas y procesos que ya se han adoptado con éxito en el mundo del desarrollo software: integración continua, test unitarios, automatización, merge requests, etc.\nTodo basado en software libre, y accesible desde el primer momento para cualquier alumno. Además, automatizando al máximo las verificaciones más estáticas, el proceso de evaluación se agiliza enormemente.\nEl propio autor lo ha puesto en práctica en varias asignaturas y también mostró ciertas evidencias de que mejora el resultado y como poco reduce las tasas de abandono en dichas asignaturas. Son pocas evidencias para que sea concluyente pero parece que el razonamiento tiene sentido.\nTermino con una cita del propio JJ que me encantó: \u0026ldquo;StackOverflow está abierto para todo el mundo, también para los profesores\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Things Network: una red IoT desplegada y mantenida por la ciudadanía, por Juan Félix Mateos Barrado\nEsta charla me sorprendió muchísimo. Tenía cierto conocimiento de oídas sobre el proyecto pero contado de primera mano me quedó todo más claro.\nThe Things Network consiste básicamente en una red global abierta basada en el protocolo LoRaWAN. En otras palabras, es una red de dispositivos IoT desplegada y mantenida por la comunidad con muchos e interesantes casos de uso.\nnos cuenta @JuanFelixMateos un caso de uso sencillo y claro de @TheThingsNtwrk: una ratonera con tecnología LoRa que nos avisará cuando se \u0026quot;ejecute\u0026quot; de forma que podamos revisar la trampa sin que pase mucho tiempo\n@esLibre_ #esLibre2020 #esLibre pic.twitter.com/8Bp4jEpSks\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) September 18, 2020  Linux, The Gothic Cathedral of our times, por Daniel Germán\nOtra charla interesantísima y muy recomendable, en la que el ponente desarrolla su opinión sobre la premisa lanzada por Eric Raymond en The Cathedral and the Bazaar. En esta obra Raymond define básicamente dos modelos de desarrollo de software:\n El modelo Catedral, en el que un grupo reducido de gente desarrolla el código y lo libera en releases (más o menos frecuentes). Muy pocos tienen acceso al código entre cada release. El modelo Bazar, en el que todo el código se desarrolla a la vista del público, y todo el mundo tiene acceso al mismo.  Ambos modelos coexisten en el software libre, siendo mucho más apropiado el segundo. Para ejemplificarlo, Eric Raymond incluso acuñó lo que llamó la Ley de Linus: Dado un número suficientemente elevado de ojos, todos los errores se vuelven obvios.\nPara Daniel Germán, las grandes catedrales de nuestro tiempo serían aquellas desarrolladas de forma abierta, sirviendo de referente y guía para el resto del mundo. El gran ejemplo de esto, que el ponente desarrollo con varios ejemplos y análisis, sería el kernel de Linux. Aprendí mucho en esta charla, y me quedé con ganas de investigar más sobre aspectos como el papel del repositorio del propio Linus Torvalds en el ecosistema Linux.\n The Linux Super-Repository, by Daniel Germán   Extremely interesting analysis around this slide: The Linux Super-repository: \u0026quot;Nobody uses Linus\u0026#39; repository\u0026quot;@esLibre_ #esLibre2020 #esLibre pic.twitter.com/MroL7mmR37\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) September 19, 2020  UXBOX, la solución libre para diseño y prototipado, por Juan de la Cruz\nYa estuve en su día en la presentación que Pablo Ruiz (@diactritica) hizo en FOSDEM, y no podía faltar a la primera presentación en castellano.\nLa charla es un resumen conciso y bien trabajado. Juan empezó con una descripción del producto, su breve historia y su propósito, y terminó con una demo bastante completa e ilustrativa de las capacidades actuales de UXBOX.\nUXBOX es una herramienta open source para diseño y prototipado. Las claves fundamentales son que es multi plataforma (al ser 100% web), está basado en estándares abiertos (principalmente SVG) y ha sido diseñado desde cero para ser usado por equipos multi disciplinares.\nOtras charlas a las que asistí y que os recomiendo ver cuando publiquen el vídeo:\n Java sigue siendo libre (y gratis), por David Gómez Código colaborativo: el gobierno del futuro, por Alba Roza LibreOffice 10th anniversary: the many faces of a global FOSS community, por Italo Vignoli Hackeando la comunicación: consejos para evitar conflictos y colaborar en comunidades abiertas, por Nuritzi Sanchez ¿Está (realmente) roto el open source?, por José Manrique López de la Fuente Public Money Public Code – Global problems need global solutions!, por Alexander Sander Comunicar el impacto social de la industria del software libre, por Jesús García García Software libre y soberanía tecnológica en la ONG Ingeniería Sin Fronteras, por Sergio Soto Taller de Introducción a Raku, por JJ Merelo Un bot (no inteligente) multi-interfaz y distribuido como asistente personal, por Fernando Tricas García Doc-As-Code, por Jorge Aguilera  Y esto es todo.

    "body": "It has been almost a month since I returned from another intense and thought-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write this before, as I have been quite busy both at work and at home.\n FOSDEM 2020 poster   For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know FOSDEM, it is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to Open Source development and communities. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) ecosystem. It\u0026rsquo;s also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them.

You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to register beforehand.\nAs usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):\nTalks How FOSS could revolutionize municipal government, by Danese Cooper\nDanese Cooper (@divadanese) complete career is amazing: former CTO at Wikimedia Foundation, board member of the Open Source Hardware Association, board observer at Mozilla and board member at Open Source Initiative,\u0026hellip; She gave at FOSDEM a very interesting and inspiring talk about the growing presence of FOSS in public administrations.\nShe started with a brief historical review of relevant projects, highlighting LinEx in Extremadura and Code For America. This initiatives to provide an open alternative for a specific purpose have sometimes failed. In the last years several projects are becoming popular with a common pattern: acting locally to impact globally.\nFor example: Jason Hibbets (@jhibbets) makes small FOSS projects for his regional county in Raleigh, North Carolina. In Baltimore, a city that was hacked and had to pay a ransom to recover its servers, the amazing people from the St. Francis Neighborhood Center lead by Jacob Green are adapting an international open source platform to provide city services, webs and other functions.\nThis international open source platform is Lutèce (@LuteceNews), developed by the City of Paris. Lutèce is a 12 years old modular and extensible platform, covering hundreds of city services. Through several projects, mainly built in Java EE, it covers from basic web capabilities to voting systems or workflow functions. Awesome.\n Lutèce facts presented in FOSDEM 2020   The Selfish Contributor Explained, by James Bottomley\nThroughout the years I\u0026rsquo;ve attended several times to James Bottomley (@jejb_) talks, and it\u0026rsquo;s always worthy. This time the talk was focused on how Open Source begins as a selfish activity. According to James, managing engineers has always been a problem, even before software exists, because they tend to be opinionated. It\u0026rsquo;s better to keep a technical motivation than a managerial motivation, but scratching your own itch provides a strong self motivation.\nIn his first announcement explaining that he was working in a new operating system, Linus Torvalds wanted just suggestions as he expected to code everything by himself, but he was flooded by suggestions and eventually patches. All successful projects run into scaling issues, so how your community or project deals with contributions is essential. Linux solved this success issue with tooling, first with BitKeeper in 2002 and later with Git in 2005.\nThe Ethics Behind Your IoT, by Molly de Blanc\nMolly de Blanc (@mmillions), Strategic Initiatives Manager at Gnome and President of the Open Source Initiative, explained how the Internet of Things is creating new risks and potential security issues due to the lack of free and open alternatives in the ecosystem.\nShe explained several examples, mainly focused on home surveillance, smart locks and smart doorbells. Smart locks are enabling a new type of abuse. If hacked (or a violent ex-partner) someone can lock you out, open without your consent, etc.\n Molly de Blanc presenting at FOSDEM 2020   Freedom and AI: Can Free Software include ethical AI systems?, by Justin W. Flory \u0026amp; Michael Nolan\nJustin (@jflory7) and Mike (@_ nolski _) gave another interesting talk about Ethics and Open Source. They started with an historical overview of GNU, the FSF and the GPL, to explain why the four essential freedoms, written by Richard Stallman in 1986, need to be adapted for AI systems. To create awareness about this, the main initiatives are the AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI.\nThey continued their presentation introducing some new Freedoms applicable to AI:\n Freedom to\u0026hellip; audit automated decision-making systems Freedom to\u0026hellip; deliver accountability and responsibility Freedom to\u0026hellip; appeal a decision  They also suggested how we, as a global community, could respect and enforce these freedoms: reproducibility, liability and responsible design, and specially human centered appealing mechanisms.\n“Human futures are a combination of data and software.”\nIn a time where software is often free, companies are selling how people behave. What a strong way to frame this point. #FOSDEM pic.twitter.com/mFYoczki0f\n\u0026mdash; Matthew Broberg is at @mbbroberg@floss.social (@mbbroberg) February 1, 2020  Organizing Open Source for Cities, by Jacob Green\nThe second talk I attended about the same topic, this time from Jacob Green (@jacoblyopen), founder of Mosslabs.io (@Moss4Cities) and open source strategist for both the City of Paris and Johns Hopkins University.\nHe explained with more detail how to enable a sustainable and free innovation in our cities, through structured collaboration and community. We need a clear, but flexible, institutional interface or framework to advance in cooperation and scaling. He showed some examples from his own initiatives in Johns Hopkins University, the City of Baltimore or the City of Paris with Lutèce (already mentioned in my summary).\nThe next generation of contributors is not on IRC, by Matthew Broberg\nI was curious about this talk by Matthew Broberg (@mbbroberg), technical editor at OpenSource.com. He explained how the communication channels can be more or less inclusive, and how they impact the community itself. He claimed that he does not get IRC, but felt great after creating easily a Github user and having solved an issue in a friendly manner. Most of the modern capabilities are not in IRC, and that is why the communities are shifting to new platforms.\nAlso, he highlighted that we should move more to asynchronous communication tools, depending on the purpose. He explained how for some people that communication platforms are the third place (after home and your workplace) where you need to feel comfortable and secure. He stressed his message explaining how different projects or companies are distributing their communication needs.\n Matthew Broberg about the communications platform adoption in FOSDEM 2020   The Ethics of Open Source, by Don Goodman-Wilson\nDon (@DEGoodmanWilson) offered the audience another view about the theme of my FOSDEM, Ethics and Open Source. Free Software gives freedom to everyone, and it can be argued that it creates opportunities for the already privileged part of the society. It exacerbates existing injustices, encourages exploiting volunteer labor force. This is reflected in the Paradox of Openness, the tension between encouraging knowledge sharing and ensuring sufficient protection for those who share.\nWe cannot settle with Open Source (as it is described today). It\u0026rsquo;s necessary but not enough to ask if something is Open Source, we need to ask ourselves other questions like:\n What are the forces that have led us to this point? What do we owe to each other as people? How do we evolve as a community?  \u0026quot;The Ethics of Open Source\u0026quot;, by Don Goodman-Wilson. @DEGoodmanWilson applying the Scanlon\u0026#39;s contractualist theory of morality to Open Source https://t.co/KlsTrTDztM #FOSDEM #FOSDEM20 @fosdem pic.twitter.com/L8YULFg2XY\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) February 2, 2020  Engineers, Call Your Policy People!, by Astor Nummelin Carlberg \u0026amp; Paula Grzegorzewska\nAstor and Paula from OpenForum Europe (@OpenForumEurope) explained their mission, connecting FOSS communities and projects with policy makers (specially in the EU). They explained what they learned during the recent campaign against the Copyright Directive, and how they created the SaveCodeShare.eu portal.\nRegulations affect for profit business, but what happens with Open Source? Activism and FOSS advocacy is needed for the future of Europe, but policy makers need evidence. They help collecting use cases showing the impact of Open Source Software and Hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation. If you can provide one of those examples, please contact them.\nBuilding Ethical Software Under Capitalism, by Deb Nicholson\nDeb Nicholson (@baconandcoconut), Director of Community Operations at Software Freedom Conservancy (@conservancy), shared her view about ethical software in the most vindictive talk of the weekend. FOSS still depends on funding, and affinity is key. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see the ROI in big FOSS projects, but how can we justify (and measure) helping people as the main business model?\nRainbow capitalism\u0026hellip; is still capitalism. Open Source exploitation\u0026hellip; is still exploitation. How can we fix things from the inside? Encouraging self-reporting, organizing strikes or walkouts if needed, but mainly building our own alternatives. We should bind our future and our software to ethical choices. She closed with two interesting thoughts: What policy changes are needed? Should we require ethical audits and ethical boards in the companies/projects?\nOnce again I\u0026#39;m attending a talk in @fosdem by Deb Nicholson (@baconandcoconut). This time about \u0026quot;Building Ethical Software Under Capitalism\u0026quot; https://t.co/UZPRib0Fvl #FOSDEM #FOSDEM20 pic.twitter.com/0Loh4UGmn3\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) February 2, 2020  UXBOX, the time for an open source online prototyping platform has arrived, by Pablo Ruiz Múzquiz\nMe dear friend Pablo (@diacritica) presented UXBOX (@uxboxtool) in the Open Source Design devroom. He delivered a complete presentation of the project, from the inception a few years ago in a πWEEK at Kaleidos to the current state of development, after receiving funding and important offers to help from external contributors from the community.\nUXBOX is the first Open Source solution for design and prototyping. It is based in open standards like SVG, open source licenses, and with a multiplatform and multidisciplinary mindset.\n  And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Brussels in FOSDEM 2021!!\n",

    "body": "Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the last year. You can read about my previous years:\n 2018 2017 (in Spanish) 2016 (in Spanish) 2015 (in Spanish) 2014 (in Spanish) 2013 (in Spanish) 2012 (in Spanish) 2011 (in Spanish)  Data     2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 \u0026hellip; Total since 2006     Total amount of plays 73 101 84 98 84  1146   Different games played 33 61 72 55 71  430   Games with 2 or more plays 9 14 9 15 13  186   Amount of gaming sessions 37 43 36 35 30  401    Evolution of my game plays over the last 5 years  Games played per year until the end of 2019   Retrospective This time, I\u0026rsquo;ll organize the analysis in categories, as the time I spent in RPG or video games is becoming much more relevant.\nBoardgames  2019 has been the year with less plays since 2009. I\u0026rsquo;ve played only 33 different games this year, and incredibly most of them were new (to me). I recorded 37 gaming sessions, 3 per month. My h-index as a player is still at 11. I expected to raise it this year, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t since I almost played new games. I have played a lot less to boardgames. Nothing unexpected as this year I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to attend Tierra de Nadie (TdN) or any similar convention. Not attending TdN implies at least 25-30 plays less. On the other side, the number of gaming sessions is not that different. And makes sense as I\u0026rsquo;m playing more to longer games. Only In 2019 I have played 19 times to Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth, in several sessions with up to 4 straight plays. I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying it a lot (as the rest of my playing group), so we are continuing with The Hunt of the Ember Crown expansion. I\u0026rsquo;m even considering starting a solitaire campaign to compare. I did not fulfill my desire to complete in 2019 all the published games of Unlock! and Exit, but I played 5 and I have bought almost all of them so it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of time.  Role-playing games  We are still maintaining our monthly Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th Edition campaign. I\u0026rsquo;ve only skipped a couple of sessions because of business trips or similar issues, and despite that I\u0026rsquo;ve attended 10 sessions. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we will continue with this in 2020 and beyond, if nothing important changes. We will see what happens when we complete the Storm King\u0026rsquo;s Thunder campaign.  Video games  This year I\u0026rsquo;ve used Steam from time to time. Chronologically:  I completed Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate II I played for a while to Icewind Dale I finished Life is Strange: Episode 1 I also completed The Witcher   By the end of the year I acquired Stadia Founder\u0026rsquo;s Edition. I started trying it with Destiny 2 but definitely enjoyed my new Stadia with Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition. Either on Steam or Stadia, I plan to play as much as I can also this year. For the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m continuing with Rise of the Tomb Raider  ",

    "body": "A few days ago I had the opportunity and the privilege to deliver three different talks, in three consecutive days, in two international events: Big Things Conference 2019 and Commit Conf 2019. This crazy coincidence forces me to write one single post to summarize my experience in both events, including an overview of my three talks.\nTaking advantage of this, I have also created a new section on this website to publish the main public talks that I\u0026rsquo;m proudly giving. For each talk you will find some basic data, a link to the slides, and also a link to the video for those that are recorded and published.\nBefore continuing, I want to thank Pablo Ruiz Subira publicly again for letting me complicate his life. I encouraged him to give a talk, and he has not only done it (three times, if we also count a Meetup talk in October) but also at a great level. It has been especially hard for him to prepare all this, at a time when his family (with a small child and a newborn baby) deserve much more attention than everything else.\n With Pablo before our packed full session at Commit Conf 2019   TLDR; Delivering three talks in just three days is tough, but as usual the feedback from your peers makes the effort worthwhile. I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with how the three talks turned out, and despite skipping several slots to prepare things and talk with as many colleagues as possible, my selection of talks was also nice and I learned a lot.\nLet me summarize some of the talks I attended (this time, including my own):\nBig Things Conference 2019 Big Things Conference 2019, previously called Big Data Spain, is one of the most relevant conferences about Big Data and Artificial Intelligence across Europe. This was the 7th edition and the first one with the new name and branding but they continued with the format of the past events with an interesting balance between technology, business propositions and innovative ideas. According to the organizers this year they had more than 2,000 attendees and 92 talks in just two days.\nStaying Safe in the AI Future, by Cassie Kozyrkov (@quaesita)\nVery interesting and appropriate opening keynote by Cassie, focusing on the problems and lack of reliability that we can introduce to the data if we don\u0026rsquo;t put enough care. I took with me several good tips to apply and nice definitions like Algorithmic bias, that occurs when a computer system reflects the implicit values of the humans that created it.\n Cassie Kozyrkov at Big Things Conference 2019   Solving Natural Language problems with scarce data, by Álvaro Barbero Jiménez (@albarjip)\nThis talk by Álvaro was one of my favorites of all the conference. He delivered a complete overview, explaining a lot of concepts and providing valuable learnings. Thanks to him I discovered interesting things like FastText and Bert.\n Álvaro Barbero Jiménez at Big Things Conference 2019   Operationalizing Data Science using the Azure stack, by María Medina (@mariamedp)\nMaría gave a very good overview of the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning stack, focusing specially on what she called the MLOps approach, using Azure capabilities to build a complete CI and CD pipelines for your ML models.\n María Medina at Big Things Conference 2019   From Big Data to Artificial Intelligence. Descriptive Vs predictive, by Marco Benjumeda\nMarco explained what could be the dream job for a soccer fan, working for a company that provides advanced analytics and insights for top clubs related to performance (past and expected) of any soccer player. He did not gave a detailed explanation on the technology side, but instead showed with passion all the capabilities provided by the tools (one by one) they are building. Interesting talk, although it could have been marked as business instead of technical.\n Marco Benjumeda at Big Things Conference 2019   From HBDM (Human-Based Data Management) to AIDM (Artificial Intelligence Data Management), by Óscar Méndez (@omendezsoto)\nÓscar gave a nice opening session for the second conference day. In summary, he explained the importance of trusted data as a concept to build on top of the rest. He also stressed the relevance of a strong business data layer, abstracting business users from the data assets complexity.\nA couple of good remarks, although he lost me with the frequent marketing messages and some bold assumptions about what others are (or aren\u0026rsquo;t doing).\nOmni-Channel Customer-Centric Strategies in a Modern Architecture, by me and Pablo Ruiz Subira (@prsubi)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working with Pablo on this topic during the last months (I could say years even). Before last Summer we decided that this could provide valuable insights for others working on similar things, so we sent a proposal. We wanted to deliver the talk we would have loved to receive a couple of years ago.\nThe talk is about the design choices, strategies and patterns that we strongly recommend to build a modern, flexible and powerful communications architecture. It contains theoretical concepts, detailed tips and an opinionated section with several lessons learned by us during this (ongoing) effort. Key messages:\n You cannot be relevant if your strategy is not customer-centric, learning from the behavior and responses of your customers You cannot be coherent if your strategy is not fully omni-channel, with advisory, commercial and operative communications serving the same purpose and strategy A micro-services architecture will help you, but focus on a proper isolation of responsibilities regardless your overall architecture design Big Data capabilities will be required for an advance and mature proposal, but it is not the first or most important component   With Pablo Ruiz at Big Things Conference 2019   You can check the slides in my talks section, but the complete message is not in the deck so consider waiting for the video (the session was recorded by the organization).\nI will not judge the value or success of the talk, but we are very happy with the result and the execution. The feedback that we have received is also very positive so I suppose it was worthy also for the audience.\nCommit Conf 2019 Commit Conf 2019 is also one of the biggest conferences in Spain related to software development. The contents are more generic and the public is completely different, as the target audience are developers or students. The numbers for 2019 were impressive: 9 tracks in parallel (+ 3 workshop tracks), more than 2,000 attendees and 140 talks/workshops.\nDesign principles for an Event Driven Architecture in an Event Driven World, by me and Pablo Ruiz Subira (@prsubi)\nSecond talk of the week for Pablo and me. First slot after the opening keynote in one of the largest spaces of the conference, and the room was packed full with people even in the floor and against the lateral walls. It\u0026rsquo;s quite thrilling to start a conference like this.\nThis is not strictly a talk about what we do in ING (although we do most of this) and neither is about encouraging anyone to build micro-services. Our objective was to explain, for those that have already decided to build a micro-services architecture, the benefits of going one step forward building a complete Event-Driven Architecture.\nWe explained several concepts, with theoretical and practical explanations combined with real examples: Event taxonomy, correlation, inference, reference data management, choreography, orchestration, data lineage, data segregation, \u0026hellip;\n Thats me (interested in what Pablo says) at Commit Conf 2019 Source: CommitConf    This time our engagement with the audience was much bigger, most probably because in Spanish we are more fluent and comfortable but also because the audience in Commit Conf is much more technical. The questions from the audience complemented perfectly the message, as a proof that they got the content perfectly to the point they were thinking on the next level and the corner cases.\nThe slides can be found as well in the talks section, but again if you are interested it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to watch the recording as it is already online (in Spanish):\n Again, very happy with the result and our execution, and the feedback we are receiving is impressively positive.\nDesign principles for an Event Driven Architecture in an Event Driven World. Gran título, gran charla de @luiyo y @prsubi #commitconf pic.twitter.com/ZXzJ0vXJrx\n\u0026mdash; César Alberca (@cesalberca) November 22, 2019  En un mundo hiperconectado, las bases de datos de grafos son tu arma secreta, by Javier Ramírez (@supercoco9)\nYet another talk about graph databases, and again about the basic concepts. I was suspicious, and the talk was clearly tagged as beginner content, but I attended anyway because I like this speaker. I discovered later that the deck was more extensive for longer sessions and sadly (for me) we skipped most of the slides I was more interested. Having said that, I discovered Gremlin and how Amazon Neptune works, and both look nice.\nVery good talk by Javier, reinforcing my eagerness to go deeper into this topic (as soon as I can park the other million things I\u0026rsquo;m dealing with nowadays).\nPython para administradores de sistemas, by Alejandro Guirao Rodríguez (@lekum)\nAlejandro, apart from a very good friend, is also an extremely good speaker. He always prepares the contents thoroughly, and he is clearly gaining confidence talk after talk, conference after conference. Proof of that was the intro and closure playing the ukelele, as an analogy of Python as a multi-purpose simple but powerful and joyful instrument.\nI loved the storyline putting the audience under the skin of Nerea, explaining how she can deal with diverse and different problems in her daily job as system administrator using just Python. Alex gave not only the examples but also useful references to the standard libraries and modules used on those examples.\nI can not imagine how this talk could have been improved in content or execution. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss it.\n Alejandro Guirao at Commit Conf 2019   Micronaut y GraalVM: La combinación perfecta, by Iván López (@ilopmar)\nAny talk by Ivan is sure success. He knows how to communicate and knows how to develop the storyline of the presentation, usually including a final demo to consolidate the message. In this talk the content was as usual very detailed and tremendously interesting, stressing how Micronaut matches perfectly with GraalVM, because of the reflection-less, AoT compilation and reactive design of Micronaut.\nSpring and other frameworks are waking up, but Micronaut clearly has a nice starting position in the race to dominate the next era of micro-services.\n Iván López at Commit Conf 2019   ¿Quién manda en tu lenguaje de programación favorito? 2019 Edition!!, by me!\nThe last and for sure the most difficult of the three talks I delivered. I already gave this talk in Codemotion 2015, but in just four years the ecosystem has changed completely so it was not just doing a few small updates. Just collecting the contents takes weeks, arranging them together in a comprehensible and interesting way (at least attempting to) takes more weeks\u0026hellip; I will consider offering this talk to other upcoming events to make up for the invested effort. The good news is that I love this topic and I really enjoy researching for it.\nI have always wondered why we always focus on the technical details, forgetting about the ethical aspects of technology. Back in 2015 I chose to focus on programming languages, but the approach can be applied to other concepts. This talk is not about which programming language has this or that capability, or which one has more functional traits. What I wanted to analyze is how ethical, diverse and healthy is a programming language and the community around it.\nIn this talk I explain what can be measured and analyzed regarding ethics and governance in programming languages, and I present a critical analysis of fourteen different languages (two more than in 2015), not just the most popular ones but specially those with some special peculiarity. Furthermore, I can spend hours talking about this but I need to be fast and concise to end in about 35-40 minutes.\n Thats me talking about Clojure at Commit Conf 2019 Source: CommitConf    The slides are already online and the storyline should be easy to follow, but if you understand Spanish I recommend you to watch the video:\n Again, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with the final materials and my execution, and the attendees gave me a extremely good feedback. I\u0026rsquo;m very glad they enjoyed it as much as I did.\n¿Quieres un buen modelo de Machine Learning? Empieza por el procesado de datos, by Axel Blanco (@drimmark)\nA well structured talk, it\u0026rsquo;s a pity that he did not enter into something more detailed but it\u0026rsquo;s fine as the talk was labeled as beginner. As a suggestion to improve, sometimes the talk was more like a commercial presentation about what Keepler (his employer) offers (both to customers and engineers).\nAxel presented the basic concepts of Big Data and Machine Learning, explaining the life cycle of the data and highlighting the importance of the data processing step not only in traditional data warehousing environments but specially in Big Data architectures where any inconsistency might introduce a terrible bias. Very interesting insights about when to apply batch or streaming processing.\n Axel Blanco at Commit Conf 2019   Déjame que te hable de Perl 6, by JJ Merelo (@jjmerelo)\n JJ Merelo at Commit Conf 2019   After my research about Raku (formerly called Perl 6) for my own talk and knowing JJ Merelo since long time ago, I was curious about this presentation. JJ is very involved internationally in the Perl community and now especially in the Raku community. Neither the talk nor the speaker disappointed.\nJJ made a nice overview of the important traits that a modern programming language needs to have, and reviewed each of them with a different language: Scala, Julia, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, Elixir, F#, Rust, \u0026hellip; When we were all wondering where Raku would appear, the speaker showed us how all those capabilities are also in Raku.\nAs a consequence, he ended his talk promoting Raku as an unbeatable language for teaching and learning, since with it you can use and understand modern patterns and usages.\nConstruyendo Cultura de Datos, by Rodrigo Quintana and Javier Serrano\nRodrigo and Javier explained how their employer, Clarity, is nurturing a Data Culture across the company, including a complete transformation in the structure of the teams. They also showed, with total transparency, their technology stack both for for traditional services and data science.\nI was surprised to see the similarities between what Clarity does with their client companies data and what we do with different platforms. Well structured and very well explained talk about strategies, languages and technologies they use in their daily challenges. I hope to see other Clarity talks one day in more detail\n Rodrigo Quintana at Commit Conf 2019   And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Big Things Conference 2020 and Commit Conf 2020 !!\n",

    "body": "Disclaimer: Out of necessity, this entry will be shorter than I would like (although it may not seem so) and in Spanish, despite more than 90% of my readers (according to Google Analytics) do not have Spanish as their main language. For the first time I managed to take notes during the trip and I had to limit myself to transcribe those notes.\nNunca había visitado Asia y llevaba años con esa espinita clavada. Este año no tenía compromisos cerrados y pensé que no tenía excusa. Inicialmente me valía casi cualquier destino porque varios me llaman la atención: Vietnam, Japón, China, Tailandia, \u0026hellip; pero una circunstancia me hizo decantarme por China y en concreto por Pekín: ofrecieron a mi hermano un mes de estancia allí y aunque mi plan era viajar sólo, resultaba apetecible y atractivo poder cenar o incluso pernoctar con él.\nAl final resultó que la elección fue perfecta por varios motivos:\n Septiembre es por defecto una de las mejores épocas del año para visitar Pekín: no está petado de turistas, el tiempo es apacible y con pocas lluvias (no me llovió ningún día, de hecho). Este año se cumplen 70 años de la Revolución Comunista China, todos los edificios oficiales y buena parte de la ciudad están especialmente engalanados para conmemorar la ocasión. Mi estancia coincidió con el Festival del Medio Otoño, la segunda festividad más grande que tienen después del Año Nuevo Chino. Los lugareños tienen un día festivo y viajan a sus ciudades de origen, dejando Pekín algo más transitable. Mi estancia también coincidía con la fase final del Mundial de Baloncesto de la FIBA, siendo las semifinales y final en Pekín.  Consideraciones generales TL;DR Pekín me encantó y me dejó una muy buena impresión. Todo es enorme, alucinante, limpio y fácil de disfrutar. El choque cultural es mucho más pequeño del que pensaba, y el único inconveniente (mínimo) es que las tarjetas bancarias occidentales sirven de poco y en ocasiones el dinero en efectivo tampoco era suficiente.\nAlgunas cifras: 11 días solamente en Pekín visitando decenas de fantásticos lugares (incluyendo una increíble ruta de senderismo por la Gran Muralla), en los que hice unas 2.700 fotos (que se dice pronto), encontré 21 cachés y abrí 455 notas para mejorar OpenStreetMap !!\nCosas que me resultaron útiles:\n Una tarjeta SIM con VPN incorporada, en mi caso comprada en Holafly. No sólo necesitas datos, necesitas la VPN Como siempre, OSMAnd en el móvil con los mapas de Pekín descargados Para poder usar las WiFis que te puedas encontrar, puede venirte bien una aplicación de VPN aparte. Yo usé Express VPN pero podría haber sobrevivido sin ella La aplicación dominante de mapas local: Amap. No se puede usar en inglés pero aún así es útil para calcular rutas en transporte público (te dice hasta lo que vas a caminar, importantísimo porque hay trasbordos de varios cientos de metros), conocer horarios fiables, revisar las puntuaciones de los usuarios en restaurantes y similar. El buscador admite términos en inglés. La aplicación del Metro de Pekín. Aunque para cálculo de rutas es mejor Amap, esta sí es en inglés y podrás buscar mejor paradas concretas, ver directamente el plano completo, confirmar el coste del trayecto, etc. Cuando estés familiarizado con el metro la usarás menos o nada, pero al principio es básica Para traducciones, Pleco (que yo no llegué a usar) o Dear Translate. A esta última le puedes pasar una imagen (de un cartel, un menú o un pantallazo de Amap) y te lo traduce razonablemente bien. Mobike, la única aplicación de alquiler de bicis que en principio podrás usar como turista. Caminar es genial y me encanta, pero ganarás un montón de tiempo y energía si cada vez que tengas que cruzar varias manzanas lo haces en bici. El precio es ridículo, unos trece céntimos de euro cada 15 minutos. Yo cargué 5 euros y no llegué a consumirlos en unos 34 trayectos para un total de 31 kilómetros recorridos. Si vas a comunicarte con gente local, necesitarás WeChat. En caso contrario, con la VPN podrás usar WhatsApp o Telegram con normalidad  A continuación resumiré mi experiencia en las principales visitas del viaje, terminando con algunas consideraciones generales. ¡Empezamos!\nPlaza de Tiananmén Despegué de Barajas a las 10 de la mañana del Lunes 9 y llegué al aeropuerto internacional de Pekín el Martes 10 sobre las 9 de la mañana (hora local). Es decir, entre volar, trasbordo y cambio de zona horaria pasaron casi 24 horas. Tras otros tres cuartos de hora de taxi desde el aeropuerto hasta el apartamento en el que me alojaba con mi hermano, a pesar del cansancio estaba deseando sentir el pulso de la ciudad y tras un almuerzo potente me marché acompañado por mi hermano a ver la Plaza de Tiananmén. Siempre que visito una ciudad nueva me gusta ir al centro neurálgico lo antes posible.\nAl llegar me encontré la primera sorpresa. A pesar de que la simbólica plaza mide casi un kilómetro de longitud y 500 metros de anchura, para acceder a ella hay sólo un puñado de puntos de acceso con un fuerte control de identificación, mochilas y cacheos. En otras ocasiones pude entrar a ella sin mucho problema pero justo ese día por algún motivo las colas eran tremendas y pudimos pasar más de media hora pasando el control de seguridad.\n Control de seguridad para acceder a Tiananmen - CC License   Primer momento de masificación, rodeados de chinos pero todos o casi todos eran visitantes de fuera de Pekín. Los habitantes locales evitarán esta zona a toda costa. Esto hace que la sensación desde la plaza sea un poco artificial, dado que por ella nadie circula o pasea, sólo se visita como un monumento más. La escena es de todos modos espectacular desde la gran explanada, frente al icónico retrato de Mao Zedong en la fachada de la Puerta de Tiananmén flanqueado por los lemas \u0026ldquo;Viva la República Popular China\u0026rdquo; y \u0026ldquo;Viva la Unidad de los Pueblos del Mundo\u0026rdquo;.\nTodo estaba ya cerrado pero pudimos pasear tranquilos por la plaza viendo por fuera el Monumento a los Héroes del Pueblo, el Mausoleo de Mao, los impresionantes edificios del Gran Salón del Pueblo o el Museo Nacional de China y la majestuosa Puerta de Zhengyangmen cerrando la plaza por el Sur.\nCalle Qianmen y Hutongs de Dashilan  Tienda en la zona comercial de Qianmen - CC License   De hecho, salimos de Tiananmén por la zona sur para rematar el día paseando por la zona comercial de la calle Qianmen y los hutongs de Dashilan.\nInciso: los hutongs son callejones de casas bajas y comercios que están por todas partes en Pekín. Algunos de ellos están en malas condiciones (incluso aunque sean zonas protegidas de interés turístico) pero otros están muy rehabilitados y son casi de lujo. En todos ellos se puede pasear tranquilamente con seguridad.\nPekín está lleno de zonas comerciales como la Calle Qianmen, están por todas partes y son gigantes. Salvo excepciones no son zonas demasiado asequibles y en realidad buena parte de lo que no son tiendas de souvenirs son comercios de marcas occidentales. Si en algo destaca esta zona sobre las otras es porque está todo muy decorado con una estética muy cuidada, con esculturas delante de las tiendas más emblemáticas y con buena cantidad de restaurantes tope gama (tampoco necesariamente asequibles). De hecho, quizá está demasiado bien puesto todo, pudiendo causar cierta sensación de parque temático. Se pueden ver rehabilitaciones o nuevas construcciones que usan materiales y acabados indistinguibles de los edificios supuestamente centenarios que están al lado.\nLos hutong de esta zona están etiquetados como el antiguo barrio rojo de Pekín, que ya no está operativo. Después de haberlos paseado un par de veces no he visto ningún parecido con otros barrios rojos que todos conocemos como el de Amsterdam. Lo que sí pude ver y disfrute mucho es a mucha gente en la misma calle o en patios jugando al Xiangqi (ajedrez chino) o a los naipes, incluso una casucha atestada de gente con varias mesas de Mahjong. Allí descubrí que existe algo tan alucinante como una mesa mezcladora de Majhong, vean el vídeo.\n Una de las muchas mesas jugando a Xiangqi en la calle - CC License   Terminamos el paseo por unas calles aledañas a Qianmen que aparentemente acaban de ser reconstruidas por completo encima de viejos hutongs existentes. De nuevo, poniendo un empeño enorme en conservar y mejorar su patrimonio imitando el estilo antiguo y usando materiales tradicionales. El paseo nos lleva hasta la zona de las antiguas delegaciones europeas, una ruta muy recomendable y llamativa para turistas americanos o nacionales pero quizá menos interesante para los turistas europeos.\nParque de Jingshan  Arte efímero en Jingshan Park - CC License   A la mañana siguiente fui directo a visitar el Parque de Jingshan. Quería ver la Ciudad Prohibida desde lo alto antes de adentrarme en ella. De camino a la entrada Este del parque crucé un hutong relativamente moderno en busca (sin éxito) de una tienda de tiro con arco. No sólo era moderno y recién renovado, me atrevería a decir que era casi lujoso. Las parcelas se veían amplias, muros altos, gruesos y regulares, puertas enormes y bellamente rematadas. En varias fachadas había incluso puntos privados de recarga de coche eléctrico.\nEl parque en sí es fantástico. Nada más entrar me encuentro un grupo de honorables ancianos escribiendo en las baldosas del suelo con agua como única tinta para sus grandes pinceles. Una lástima no entender lo que ponían, pero al menos estéticamente la caligrafía me pareció impecable. El parque está lleno, como en muchos otros parajes de Pekín, de gente haciendo todo tipo de ejercicio.\nLos antiguos pabellones de Shou Huang y el famoso mirador situado sobre la cima de la artificial Colina del Carbón no hacen sino acrecentar la sensación de majestuosidad del lugar.\n Las fabulosas vistas desde el Pabellón de la Primavera Duradera - CC License   Parque de Beihai Me pareció espectacular allí y ahora en retrospectiva puede que incluso más. Lo recorrí muy tranquilamente casi por completo, caminando dado que aquí dentro no se permiten las bicicletas debido a la habitual masificación. Yo no encontré demasiada gente, la verdad.\nEl Parque Beihai es el jardín imperial más grande del mundo, y sin duda el lago con su isla central le dan al parque un ambiente único. Situado al norte del parque, el Palacio de Jingxin (Habitación del Corazón Calmado) es uno de los rincones con más encanto quizá de toda la ciudad. Es también imprescindible la visita al Muro de los 9 Dragones, que es espectacular pero puede pasar inadvertido al turista despistado dado que se encuentra fuera de los caminos principales.\n Muro de los 9 Dragones, en Beihai Park - CC License   Tras Beihai me dirigí a recorrer los alrededores del Lago Houhai, abarrotado de comercios y restaurantes. El hutong de Nanguanfang es una de las zonas más populares para los turistas de fuera, y se nota perfectamente tanto en los precios como en la oferta de tiendas y restaurantes. Es un paseo agradable pero no ví nada que pusiera en peligro mi economía.\nTorres del Tambor y del Campanario Muy cerca de la calle Nanguanfang se encuentran la Torres del Tambor y del Campanario, perfectamente alineadas al norte del eje que forman la Ciudad Prohibida y Tiananmén. Según lo previsto, llegué a la Drum Tower un poco antes del pase que hacen un par de veces al día, con el tiempo justo para subir los chopocientos escalones, poder tomar un poco de aire y coger sitio para grabar en primera fila el espectáculo. El show dura unos dos minutos y recrea el ritual que seguían antiguamente allí. Me llamó entonces la atención que el trío que ejecuta el show es liderado por una mujer, que golpeaba enérgicamente el tambor más grande y (supongo) importante, en una ciudad en la que el 99,99% de los policías y militares eran varones.\n Espectáculo de percusión en la Torre del Tambor - CC License   Una vez abajo, en principio no debes irte sin subir de nuevo los chopocientos escalones de la Torre del Campanario, pero lo cierto es que las vistas son peores y lo que encuentras arriba es menos interesante salvo que seas fan de las campanas. Hay una curiosa narración de cómo se forjan las campanas en lo alto de la torre, que pude entender por encima al estar todo casi únicamente en chino.\nTerminé ese día paseando por la zona comercial de Luogu Lane, mi plan habitual cuando parques, edificios o museos ya han cerrado y está cerca el anochecer. Esta zona comercial es de las más indistinguibles de cualquier centro comercial europeo/occidental. Salvo por algunos carteles y un par de tiendas de souvenirs, la gran mayoría de locales y marcas son las mismas que nos rodean a nosotros.\nCiudad Prohibida Me levanto de nuevo prontísimo, siguiendo la recomendación de todas las guías y de mi propio hermano, para entrar de los primeros a la Ciudad Prohibida (que ahora se conoce también como Palace Museum) y así evitar las interminables colas de turistas. Comprar la entrada con antelación te permite evitar una importante y concurrida cola, pero igualmente hay otras colas, y un interesante cuello de botella en el control de seguridad y acceso. Es el principal monumento de la ciudad y se nota. El primer control de seguridad dura no más de 5-10 minutos, es el mismo que ya pasé el primer día para acceder a la Plaza de Tiananmén, pero esta vez hay más cintas y agentes preparados para la hora punta.\nTras dicho control, accedo ligeramente emocionado al recinto de la Ciudad Prohibida para encontrarme el primer patio ya abarrotado con miles de turistas chinos y unos pocos extranjeros que han madrugado aún más. Los turistas locales guardan innumerables colas ordenada y pacientemente mientras yo y alguno más curioseamos por la zona.\nA las 8:30 abren puntualmente los controles de acceso y allí me encuentro la única situación en la que he visto que Pekín no ha conseguido escalar. Gente arrojando sus bolsos y mochilas a la cinta de seguridad y pasando de varios en varios a través de los arcos detectores de metales, que obviamente no paraba de pitar. El personal de seguridad ponía más empeño en que la llegada fuera en filas que en contener la avalancha, aparentemente resignados a lo inevitable. La marabunta de gente esperando en el primer patio no está dispuesta a esperar para visitar, y yo con ellos pensando que después vendrían marabuntas mayores.\nUna vez dentro confirmo que el sitio dispone de muy pocas explicaciones, y lo poco que hay es en Chino. Un buen porcentaje de gente visita el recinto con guías privados o grupos organizados, que van narrando y explicando la visita. Adquiero una audioguía que me permita ir un poco más libre y voy rápidamente hacia el Palacio de la Pureza Celestial, el Salón de la Unión y el Palacio de la Tranquilidad Terrenal, que son los principales cuellos de botella. No soy el único que lo piensa y allí nos agolpamos muchísimos detrás de una valla que a su vez se encuentra a varios metros de la puerta del templo, por lo que la visión y percepción de lo que hay allí dentro se hace difícil y definitivamente muy incómoda.\nDespués de ver en estas penosas condiciones viendo todo casi a codazos (educados y suaves, pero codazos igualmente), decido salir del circuito principal y visitar las zonas menos concurridas. La primera visita no podía ser otra que el Pabellón Arquero, que al final me decepciona ligeramente. La descripción histórica del lugar es muy interesante pero el contenido actual no tiene mucho de arqueril. Hay un arco, un carcaj y un puñado de flechas junto con un buen montón de otros elementos como sillas de montar a caballo. El pabellón no sólo servía como galería de tiro, sino para enfatizar la importancia del tiro con arco en la sociedad. Los emperadores Qianlong y Jiaqing recordaban constantemente a su corte que no debían olvidar sus tradiciones, su eslógan escrito por todas partes era \u0026ldquo;Habla el lenguaje Manchú, practica tiro con arco y monta a caballo\u0026rdquo;.\n Algunos de los objetos expuestos en el Pabellón Arquero de la Ciudad Prohibida - CC License   Ya dentro de la Galería del Tesoro, lo primero que encontramos es una nueva Pared de los Nueve Dragones. Me gusta también y se percibe hecha con más detalle que la de Bei Hai pero me impactó más la otra, quizá por ser la primera que he visto o porque al ser de doble cara y estar en mitad de un patio llama mucho más la atención. Aquí escucho una de las pocas anécdotas interesantes que me cuenta la audioguía, relativa a un fragmento de la pared hecho de madera y no de cerámica. Dice la leyenda que los artesanos que fabricaron contrarreloj dicha pared para el emperador cometieron un error de última hora y rompieron un trozo de un dragón. No tenían tiempo para moldear y cocer un nuevo azulejo, así que decidieron montarlo en madera tallada y lacarlo para que no se notara la diferencia. Con el paso de los años la diferencia fue evidente (y ahora salta a la vista desde cierta distancia) pero el truco supuestamente permitió salvar la vida de aquellos artesanos.\nLa Galería del Tesoro se paga aparte de la visita principal al Palace Museum y no es lo más destacable, pero considerando la cantidad de piezas expuestas y que proporcionalmente ocupa un buen trozo de la Ciudad Prohibida, considero recomendable adquirir este ticket extra aunque sólo sea por recorrer estos patios y templos, disfrutando en cada uno de ellos tanto del contenido expuesto como del continente.\nAl regresar al track principal descubro mi error inicial al seguir a la marabunta para ver los principales pabellones. Quizá en temporada alta la marabunta sea continua pero en esta temporada se ve claramente que hay un pico tremendo a primera hora formado por la gente de los viajes organizados (que visitan sólo lo principal y a toda leche) y de los incautos lectores de guías de viajes. Pude ver de nuevo todo con menos de una décima parte de la gente que tuve antes alrededor, sin codazos ni empujones y pudiendo hacer fotos tranquilo desde primera fila. Se puede decir que por el mismo precio yo visité la Ciudad Prohibida 1,3 veces porque repetí las principales zonas :-)\nEl Jardín Imperial, situado en el extremo norte, me resulto muy agradable pero siendo el sitio más fresco y sombreado también era el más concurrido. De los palacios de la zona Este y Oeste poco puedo decir porque la mitad estaban cerrados y la otra mitad tampoco me pareció que destacaran sobre lo ya visitado.\nOtra zona con ticket aparte es el Museo de Relojes. Se visita rápido y es muy interesante, siendo una de las colecciones de relojes más completas y espectaculares del mundo. La colección está formada tanto por relojes obsequiados a los emperadores a lo largo de la historia como los fabricados allí mismo en el Palacio. Muy interesante, a pesar de no disponer de información detallada de algunos de ellos, que me habria gustado investigar en profundidad.\n Figuras decorativas en los tejados de la Ciudad Prohibida, exclusivas de los edificios imperiales - CC License   Termino mi estancia bajando de nuevo a la zona sur para visitar el Salón de la Eminencia Militar, subir a la Puerta del Sur y recorrer un trozo de muralla, terminando con una visita al Salón de la Gloria Literaria que sirve de galería de arte, principalmente de pintura. Esta exposición es de lo que más me gustó de todo el Palace Museum. Las obras reflejaban situaciones cotidianas supuestamente reales de los emperadores en Palacio y algunos de los cuadros eran espectaculares.\nTemplo Imperial Ancestral Salgo de la ciudad Prohibida por la Puerta Este y me dirijo al Templo Imperial Ancestral, tras descansar un rato frente al magnífico foso. Tenía muchas ganas de visitar este jardín y sus templos, pero me decepcionó un poco. La zona es muy bonita, aunque nada que destaque sobre lo ya visto en el Palace Museum, pero su mayor punto a favor quizá sea que se encuentra casi vacío. Con una Ciudad Prohibida que recibe decenas de miles de visitantes al día, no se explica que casi nadie se tome la molestia de completar la visita viendo esto también, que está junto a la entrada. Tampoco ayuda que de sus varios templos sólo se puede visitar uno y no tiene excesivo contenido. Quizá sea más interesante para aquellos que lo visiten en lugar de entrar a la Ciudad Prohibida, o al menos en fechas diferentes.\nEl sitio es en cualquier caso muy pintoresco y lo que sí descubrí fue que estando casi vacío es ideal para fotos de boda. En un paseo breve por los jardines me encontré a más de una decena de parejas posando para sus respectivos séquitos de fotógrafos. En un callejón entre dos templos encontré incluso un par con equipos de rodaje semi-profesional que presumiblemente rodaban algún corto.\n Una de las múltiples parejas que se fotografiaban en el Templo Imperial Ancestral - CC License   Museo Nacional de China Aproveché que estaba cerca y quedaban unas 3 horas para su cierre para visitar el Museo Nacional de China. Me di un primer paseo de reconocimiento para ver si merecía la pena volver otro día y después visité con más calma las galerías principales. Apenas hay explicaciones en inglés y buena parte de las salas eran exposiciones temporales o especiales que se pagaban aparte, aunque el museo es gratuito.\nMe gustó especialmente la sección Ancient China, que explica y narra la evolución del arte en China desde sus primeros pobladores. Se describe de forma clara y didáctica el paso de la historia por las distintas dinastías, siendo muy perceptible el salto en calidad y riqueza en las Xing y Ming.\nOtra exhibición interesante fue la de regalos de estado, donde se exponen todos los obsequios recibidos por otros gobiernos u organizaciones. Resultaba interesante comparar la calidad de los regalos según la riqueza del país donante y su afiliación con el sistema político de China, a veces con cierta desproporción.\nRecomendación bonus: Hay varios restaurantes especializados en el famoso Pato al estilo Pekín, uno de ellos que probé y recomiendo es: Quanjude (30 Qianmen St, Dongcheng, Beijing, China)\nMuseo Mulitar de la Revolución Popular de China Llegó el Viernes 13, y con ello la primera jornada de mi viaje claramente impactada por nuestra asistencia (organizada a ultimísima hora) al Mundial de Baloncesto de la FIBA. Compré la noche anterior entradas para las semifinales (España - Australia) y siendo el partido a las 16:00 la visita de la mañana no podía ser muy lejos. Tenía previsto visitar el Military Museum y estando cerca del pabellón de baloncesto encajaba perfectamente adelantar la visita. Además, siendo festivo nacional en China por el Festival del Medio Otoño, mi hermano pudo acompañarme a ambas cosas dado que en la Universidad habían cerrado.\nAl llegar enfrente del Museo Mulitar de la Revolución Popular de China, nos recibe orgullosa y esbelta una gran estrella roja encima del edificio principal. Es habitual en todos los edificios oficiales pero quizá aquí se muestra más majestuosa si cabe (no será casual). Nada más entrar al edificio una gran estatua de Mao nos saluda. Todo confirmaba una sensación de propaganda de la que nos habían advertido en blogs y en la Lonely Planet, pero lo cierto es que aunque el Museo hace una gran apología de la grandeza de China y de su poderío lo que yo encontré fue un punto de vista abierto.\nLa primera parte que se debe visitar (y ojo con hacerlo en orden, no está muy bien indicado) es un recorrido histórico a lo largo de varias salas, relatando la evolución militar y geopolítica durante toda la complejísima historia China. La exposición es muy detallada, y aunque como siempre echamos de menos más texto en inglés lo cierto es que se entiende que no lo prioricen porque se veía un turista occidental por cada muchísimos locales. Como arquero tradicional, salí encantado de esta zona. Hay bastantes ejemplares expuestos (especialmente de la dinastía Xing) y bastantes dioramas poniendo en valor su uso y la imporancia de su buen manejo tanto a nivel militar como incluso social.\nLa parte central del museo es espectacular. Al estilo del Air \u0026amp; Space Museum del Smithsonian, allí tienen expuestos decenas de aviones, cohetes y barcos. Como complemento en la planta inferior tienen decenas de tanques y sistemas de armamento pesado, y en las plantas superiores todo tipo de armamento ligero: pistolas, espadas, fusiles, armas automáticas, etc. Nos sorprendió (y agradó) ver que tanto en la planta baja como en las superiores junto a las piezas chinas tenían expuestas muchísimas de otros países, destancando de la URSS, USA y Japón pero también muchas europeas e incluso españolas.\n Vista parcial de la parte central del Museo Mulitar de la Revolución Popular de China - CC License   Además de la recopilación interminable e interesante de armamento, tenían varias zonas de exposiciones sobre el potencial chino en armamento aéreo y marítimo, y las posibilidades no bélicas dela energía nuclear. La parte final, que también nos sorprendió positivamente, se centraba en arte de inspiración bélica: cuadros y esculturas principalmente. Había obras fabulosas, varias de las cuales yo colgaría en mi salón sin dudarlo.\nWukesong Arena Una vez visto el museo nos dirijimos a Wukesong, un area comercial gigante rodeada de grandes eficios de varias plantas con muchas más tiendas. Este mini-barrio comercial alberga en su interior el Wukesong Arena, que fue construido para los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008 como sede para la competición de baloncesto.\nLa zona comercial principal está muy orientada al exterior y al ocio. Hay varias pistas deportivas, muchos restaurantes e incluso un IKEA que no destacaba en tamaño como suele suceder aquí en España. Aunque estaba muy animado (y aparentemente no era por la competición) no es un sitio que tenga sentido visitar salvo que te alojes muy cerca.\nSobre el baloncesto, España derrotó por 95-88 a Australia en un apasionante partido que tuvo perdido casi todo el tiempo pero finalmente se llevó tras dos emocionantes prórrogas.\n Con mi hermano celebrando la victoria en la semifinal del Mundial FIBA de Baloncesto - CC License   Mercado de Antigüedades de Panjiayuan Este famoso Mercado de Antigüedades de Panjiayuan ofrece más o menos lo que esperaba: muchos clientes, casi exclusivamente locales, y una gran cantidad y diversidad de productos. No todo son antigüedades (ni siquiera lo que parece serlo), buena parte de la extensión del mercado lo ocupan puestos de venta de piedras pulidas y/o talladas de todo tipo de colores.\nEl sitio me gustó mucho y me parece una visita obligada. Compres o no compres es muy llamativo e interesante recorrer pasillos y pasillos de puestos, organizados más o menos por tipología: cerámica, figuras de barro o metal, tallas en madera, piedras, nueces secas, libros, muebles, ilustraciones, herramientas de caligrafía, bustos e incluso ropa.\nAl final no compré nada. No estaba aún habituado al regateo (que además no me gusta demasiado) y las dos o tres cosas que sí me habría apetecido comprar no las pude (o supe) negociar bien. Pensaba que encontraría algo similar más adelante y aunque muchas cosas se repiten en varios puestos, sí puedes encontrar piezas que sólo un vendedor tiene. Ellos lo saben y aprietan más en la negociación.\nLo que me alucinó verdaderamente fue la gran cantidad de puestos vendiendo nueces. Los ejemplares grandes y muy simétricos son especialmente cotizados por temas culturales y tradicionales, pero allí vendían de todo tipo y tamaño. Veías en algunos puestos a compradores revisando durante minutos cada nuez que se llevaban, cuando para unos ojos no entrenados todas eran prácticamente iguales.\n Escrutinio de nueces en Panjiayuan - CC License   Recomendación bonus: Como nota de interés para mis lectores habituales, tras buscarlos por todo Pekín creo que Panjiayuan es el mejor sitio para comprar un Xiangqi o ajedrez chino relativamente artesanal.\nDistrito de Arte 798 Este Distrito de Arte 798, un espacio dedicado al arte que es realmente todo un distrito en el que ya no hay otra cosa, también me fascinó. Innumerables galerías de arte se mezclan con showrooms de grandes estudios y pequeños diseñadores. Han conseguido integrar perfectamente el entorno industrial de una forma fabulosa, sin hacer ningún sacrificio al disfrute de los visitantes. Entramos a unas pocas galerías, algunas de entrada gratuita y otras por un módico precio para evitar paseantes, y en general todas tenían su interés. De hecho, lo que menos nos gustó fue la UCCA, cuya entrada no era para nada barata y la exposición temporal no merecía demasiado la pena.\n Fusión de arte y elementos industriales en el Distrito 798 - CC License   Junto al arte, las omnipresentes tiendas de todo tipo, bares, restaurantes, \u0026hellip; otro lugar de esparcimiento más para los locales que también engancha a muchos turistas a pesar de estar lejos del centro.\nPalacio de Verano El Domingo 15 me levanté muy pronto para ver si me daba tiempo a ver primero el Palacio de Verano y después Yuanmingyuan Park (el antiguo Palacio de Verano). Nada más llegar al Summer Palace tuve que dedicar buena parte de mi atención y tiempo a un intento de última hora para conseguir entradas para ver la final del Mundial FIBA de baloncesto esa misma tarde. Al final las gestiones dieron sus frutos, pero tuve que recortar el tiempo dedicado al antiguo Palacio de Verano para poder llegar al partido.\nEl Palacio de Verano me gustó mucho, a pesar de que sólo pude rodear a medias el inmenso Lago Kunming. La parte oeste requería mucho más tiempo, lo dejo pendiente para una futura visita. Todos los palacios y torres del recinto me gustaron pero lo que me encantó fue la disposición en general de todo, se nota que cada detalle está muy cuidado.\nEmpecé recorriendo muy pausada y tranquilamente toda la zona norte por todos sus caminos, incluyendo el fantástico Jardín de de los Placeres Armoniosos. Tras disfrutar tranquilo de esa zona, al acercarme al lago empecé a notar una cantidad brutal de gente que enturbió un poco la experiencia.\nBajé caminando hasta cruzar el Puente de los 17 Arcos que comunica con la fantástica Isla Nanhu, que alberga el templo al Rey Dragón, que no podía dejar de visitar. Tras la isla, nuevamente abarrotada, preferí evitar tener que subir andando de nuevo hacia el norte esquivando gente. En este lago, commo en otros, hay numerosos barcos de distintos tamaños, con y sin piloto, que cruzan el lago en todas las direcciones. Elegí uno que cruzase en diagonal el lago y subí directo hasta el Barco de Mármol, que con sus 36 metros de largo luce orgulloso a orillas del lago. El trayecto fue rápido y mereció mucho la pena, las vistas a ras de agua son impresionantes tanto de la isla que abandonaba detrás como de la Colina de la Longevidad y sus templos. A pesar nuevamente de la importante cantidad de barcos que te rodean en todo momento.\nLa orilla norte estaba si cabe aún más llena de gente, siendo la zona más atractiva para los turistas que no pretenden caminar demasiado. Todo estaba lleno de gente, incluyendo especialmente el Gran Corredor, un largo pasillo cubierto de de 728 metros de longitud fantásticamente decorado. Merece la pena pasearlo tranquilamente disfrutando de las más de 14.000 pinturas, que representan episodios tanto históricos como fantásticos.\nDejé para el final la subida a la Colina de la Longevidad, coronada por la imponente Pagoda del Buda Fragante.\n El fantástico Lago Kunming desde lo alto de la Colina de la Longevidad - CC License   Antiguo Palacio de Verano Era ya tarde y tenía que comer algo rápido para reunirme con mi hermano en la entrada sur del Yuanmingyuan Park o Antiguo Palacio de Verano, también conocido como el Jardín del Perfecto Brillo. En su día fue un complejo enorme de palacios y jardines, al igual que el Palacio de Verano fueron destruidos por los británicos y los franceses en el siglo XIX pero esta parte no se ha llegado nunca a restaurar.\nEs inmenso y no teníamos tiempo de verlo todo, por lo que decidimos pasear por la parte oeste del parque que tiene quizá menos encanto pero desde luego estaba menos masificada. Entre las ruinas de antiguos templos y palacios, en la mayoría sólo queda una placa y la silueta en el suelo, destaco el Edificio de la Paz Universal con forma de esvástica. Dicha forma, además de su simbología en el budismo, permitía al emperador elegir la habitación más apropiada según la temporada del año.\nHay de nuevo muchos lagos y canales conectando unos con otros, y bastantes barcos cruzando los mismos. Esta vez predominaban los barcos de uso privado, aunque también los había tipo ferry para paseos colectivos.\n Embarcación de recreo surcando tranquilamente uno de los muchos canales del Antiguo Palacio de Verano - CC License   Desde el Antiguo Palacio de Verano fuimos de nuevo directos a Wukesong para presenciar la fantástica Final del Mundial FIBA de Baloncesto, que España conquistó al derrotar a Argentina por 75 a 95. Pasamos un gran rato viendo el partido y toda la ceremonia posterior de entrega de premios, que disfrutamos enormemente sin la intermediación habitual de una televisión. El público, mayoritariamente local, empezó animando claramente a España, para luego posicionarse a favor de Argentina intentando que la final tuviera algo de emoción. La Selección española encarriló muy pronto el partido y la afición local volvió a animar apasionadamente al ganador. Había bastantes aficionados locales con camisetas de los jugadores españoles, principalmente de Ricky Rubio.\n Tiempo muerto en la final del Mundial FIBA de Baloncesto, no es mala foto para estar hecha sin trípode y desde el gallinero - CC License   Senderismo por la Gran Muralla: De Jiankou a Mutianyu Estuve valorando ir por mi cuenta uno o dos días a recorrer la Gran Muralla. Al final un dolor en el pie y no tener forma material de llamar por teléfono en caso de emergencia me inclinó a contratar una ruta organizada. Creo que fue un enorme acierto, y debería haberlo hecho aunque no hubiera tenido esos inconvenientes.\nEntre las muchas empresas que ofrecen este tipo de rutas me decanté por China Hiking, y concretamente por su ruta de Jiankou a Mutianyu de 1 día (http://www.chinahiking.cn/great-wall-hiking/jiankou-to-mutianyu-great-wall-hike-and-tobogan-1-day/). Hay varias zonas de la Muralla visitables, algunas de ellas muy restauradas y asequibles con transporte público casi directo desde Pekín como Badaling que están totalmente masificadas. Hay zonas menos visitadas pero más lejos de Pekín, lo que complica mucho poder hacer una ruta interesante de un día. La zona de Mutianyu también se llena, pero sería sólo el final de la ruta.\nLa excursión comienza en la salida de la estación de metro de Lama Temple, un punto céntrico y muy bien comunicado pero ya orientado hacia las salidas norte de la ciudad. Allí nos recogió el minibus a dos guías y una docena de excursionistas: 4 niños y 9 adultos. Tras dos horas de carretera incluyendo una parada técnica para ir al baño y comprar algún snack en una tienda de ultramarinos, llegamos al punto de inicio de la ruta: el pueblo de Nanjili. Estamos aún algo retirados de la muralla por su fachada norte, justo encima de Jiankou.\nComentario curioso: Jiankou significa \u0026ldquo;Arrow Nock\u0026rdquo;, debido a la forma de la montaña en este área.\n Increíbles vistas desde la Torre de Zhengbeilou, viendo cómo la Gram Muralla continúa hacia el Oeste - CC License   La ruta comienza fuerte, con casi 1 kilómetro de subida bastante empinada por estrechos senderos de monte hasta llegar a la Torre de Zhengbeilou, a la que trepamos de la única manera posible: usando una robusta escalera hecha con ramas. Así acechaban los mongoles,llegando entre los árboles y la maleza y trepando de con elementos improvisados en la zona, aunque en aquella época aparentemente los chinos se encargaban de talar todos los árboles y la maleza cercanos a la muralla por la zona norte para evitar que nadie llegase desapercibido.\n La Gran Muralla totalmente inmersa en la naturaleza - CC License   Tras una parada en lo alto de la torre para descansar y comer algo ligero, salimos hacia el este por una parte de la muralla bastante salvaje. En todo este trozo, la naturaleza prácticamente ha engullido a la muralla y sólo hay un pequeño sendero transitable por lo alto de la misma. Desde dentro se aprecia perfectamente, pero con cierta altura puede incluso no verse tanto por los árboles colindantes que ya superan en altura la muralla como por los matorrales que crecen en lo alto de la misma. Tal y como noso advierten los guías hay que cruzar con cuidado, el terreno es irregular e incluso el muro lateral se ha desprendido en varios trozos, pero la experiencia es fabulosa. Además, sólo nos encontramos con otro pequeño grupo de tres personas en todo este tramo.\nA lo largo de la ruta, los guías nos descubren aspectos curiosos y para mi desconocidos, como que toda la muralla se construía con cierta pendiente y desagües hacia el lado chino de forma que el agua de lluvia nunca llegara al enemigo, o que cada torre es diferente por dentro para evitar que si alguna caía en manos enemigas se pusiera en peligro toda la estructura. Al menos las que atravesé, y fueron unas cuantas, cumplían dicho patrón.\nAl final de este tramo sin restaurar llegamos a un trozo semi restaurado, en el que nos encontramos ya un mini puesto de recuerdos y bebidas, básicamente una señora con un tablón con cosas encima. Los guías nos avisaban con escrupuloso detalle y antelación de todo, incluyendo estos puestos, por lo que deben ser viejos conocidos.\n Una zona mucho más transitable de la Gran Muralla, pero con igual encanto - CC License   Finalmente llegamos a la zona de Mutianyu, mucho más restaurada y plagada de gente que pulula desde el centro de visitantes. En esta zona y con tanta gente hicimos la bajada cada uno a su ritmo hasta la siguiente torre, charlando con unos y con otros. Es curioso pasar en poco tiempo de una zona en la que estabamos prácticamente solos en varios kilómetros de muralla, a otra en la que cada pocos metros había alguien subiendo, bajando o sentado descansando (las pendientes son enormes).A este fragmento de muralla se puede llegar por sendero, por escaleras, por telesilla y por teleférico. Son todo facilidades y se nota.\n En esta foto se aprecia bastante bien alguna de las increíbles pendientes que tiene la Gran Muralla - CC License   Recomendación Bonus: a estos medios de subida se une un enorme tobogán como opción de bajada, que es la que utilicé yo junto a algunos compañeros de ruta. El tobogán recorre más de 1.500 metros y salva una pendiente bastante importante. Abajo te espera tu foto en el vagón al más puro estilo Parque de Atracciones. Recomendable pero dejad espacio entre el anterior y el siguiente para evitar accidentes y para disfrutar al máximo del descenso.\nUna vez abajo, cruzamos innumerables tiendas y restaurantes para llegar al hub de autobuses, con lanzaderas que te bajan al pueblo. El tráfico está restringido y nuestro minibus nos tuvo que esperar en el parking que hay abajo. Como parte de la excursión, nos llevaron a un restaurante enorme a las afueras de Pekín para comer todos juntos. Allí comimos en un comedor privado con la típica mesa redonda enorme con una pieza central que gira. Por dicha pieza giratoria fueron pasando más de 10 platos distintos de exquisita comida local, que nos dejaron a todos muy satisfechos incluyendo los niños y tres de los adultos que eran vegetarianos.\nDe nuevo, recomiendo ampliamente esta zona y esta manera de visitar la muralla. No he probado con otros, pero desde luego esta empresa resolvió todo de forma fantástica. No resultó mucho más caro que si lo hubiera hecho por mi cuenta y fue más seguro y ameno. Un poco más tarde de la hora convenida nos dejaron de nuevo en la boca de metro y allí nos despedimos todos encantados del día que habíamos pasado juntos. La comida había sido copiosa y tardía, por lo que me marché directo al apartamento sin parar a cenar.\nTemplo de Yonghe Depués de un lunes intenso, el Martes 17 empecé fuerte con el Templo de Yonghe o de los Lamas. Es uno de los sitios con más encanto de Pekín aunque no aparece en el top de muchas guías de viaje. Casi por primera vez, visitaba un monumento que aún está en uso, ya que sigue sirviendo en la actualidad como templo budista.\nLa visita transcurre a lo largo de varios altares y templos, decorados en una interesante mezcla de arte tradicional chino, mongol y tibetano. Los dos últimos son sin duda los más impresionantes, destacando el último de ellos por contener la talla de una única pieza de madera más grande del mundo (certificado por el Libro Guiness de los Records), en forma de Buda de 26 metros de altura (8 de ellos bajo tierra). Espectacular.\nEn cada templo y altar, los numerosos feligreses (y algunos turistas con dudoso respeto) quemaban incienso a mansalva y lo ofrecían a sus ídolos tras varias reverencias. Repetían el ritual en cada templo, y en ocasiones varias veces por cada una de las tallas que se encontraban.\n El fabuloso Pabellón Wanfuge en Templo de Yonghe - CC License   Templo de Confucio Después del Templo Lamaísta visité el cercano Templo de Confuncio, el segundo templo de veneración de Confucio más grande de China. Este templo comparte recinto con la Imperial Academy de Beijing, uno de los centros de estudios más prestigiosos de China.\nEl Templo de Confucio tiene, aparte de pabellones de culto, una parte de exposición donde se explica la vida y obra de Confucio. Todos los edificios se siguen utilizando, incluyendo ceremonias de graduación de estudiantes.\nParque Olímpico Llegué al Parque Olímpico de Pekín antes de lo esperado y no pude disfrutar mucho de él porque aún hacía mucho calor y en toda la explanada apenas hay sombras. Aún así, completé un buen paseo por toda la zona y pude imaginarme allí durante el vibrante ambiente de unas olimpiadas.\nEs increíble que pudieran disponer de todo este espacio tan cerca del centro de la ciudad y lo organizaran de esta manera, incluyendo un río artificial con forma de dragón.\n Estadio Nacional de Pekín en el soleado Parque Olímpico - CC License   Recomendación bonus: No coge demasiado cerca pero después de esta visita me junté con mi hermano para cenar en un fantástico restaurante especializado en cocinar con pera: Xiao Diao Li Tang (Zhongguancun South 1st Alley, Wudaokou, Haidian, Beijing, China): Además de muchos platos cocinados con pera, servían una fabulosa bebida melosa de pera que servían por jarras e incluso para llevar en botellas. Riquísimo.\nTemplo del Cielo Comencé mi paseo por el Templo del Cielo muy temprano en la puerta Este, resistiendo la tentación de entrar de nuevo en el Mercado de la Perla. Recorrí tranquilamente toda la zona este del parque para acceder y recorrer el templo de Sur a Norte como hacían los emperadores.\nPor el camino me encontré gente haciendo todo tipo de deporte y ejercicio, como en cada parque de Pekín. Aquí incluso habían improvisado una pista de tenis en una pequeña explanada pavimentada.\nEl Templo de la Oración por la Buena Cosecha, el Altar Circular y el Muro del Eco son muy singulares y todos ellos lugares icónicos de Pekín que merece la pena visitar tranquilamente. También visité el Palacio del Ayuno, que es gratuito enseñando el pasaporte pero por algún motivo casi nadie visita.\n El maravilloso Templo de la Oración por la Buena Cosecha, una de las estampas icónicas de Pekín - CC License   Museo de la Arquitectura Antigua Este Museo de la Arquitectura Antigua, que tampoco suele aparecer en ninguna guía o blog de viajes y de hecho estaba casi vacío, cumplió con creces mis espectativas. Está situado en lo que antiguamente fue el importante Templo de la Agricultura, y por ello tiene una zona dedicada también a esto.\nSobre arquitectura, hay recreaciones de todo tipo para poder hacerse una idea de la técnica y materiales empleados en la construcción tradicional china. Hay zonas dedicadas a las vigas, incluyendo la selección de la madera apropiada; a la cerámica tanto protectora como decorativa; a la talla de piedra, etc. Lástima que como en el resto de Pekín me perdiese el 90% de las explicaciones porque apenas hay contenido en otros idiomas.\n Museo de la Arquitectura Antigua en el Templo de la Agricultura, donde el continente impresionaba tanto o más que el contenido - CC License   Museo de la Ciencia y la Tecnología de China Poco que decir sobre este museo. Es gigante, muy bien organizado y aparentemente (de nuevo, casi todo en chino) contiene bastantes explicaciones. Tiene las típicas zonas de este tipo de museos: geología, biología, naturaleza, etc. para rematar en una planta dedicada a la tecnología muy destacable. No todo estaba operativo, pero tenían multitud de espacios interactivos incluyendo realidad virtual y realidad aumentada. Muy recomendable, especialmente con niños pero también para adultos.\nZona comercial de Sanlitun De nuevo, con todo cerrado no queda mucho que seguir paseando o entrando en zonas comerciales que sí abren hasta muy tarde. Uno de los últimos días me pasé por Sanlitun que es de las zonas comerciales más popuares de Pekín.\nSanlitun está pegado al distrito de las embajadas y cerca de la zona donde residen los expatriados, quizá por eso es el lugar donde más concentración hay de tiendas de lujo y marcas occidentales en general. Es una zona muy renovada, con edificios enormes que cambian de color y muchísimos restaurantes. Interesante por el paseo pero de nuevo con poco riesgo para mi economía por los elevados precios.\nMuseo Nacional de Arte de China No quise irme de Pekín sin visitar el Museo Nacional de Arte de China, cuya nueva sede han construido hace unos poco años muy cerca de la Ciudad Prohibida.\nEste museo albergaba la 8ª Bienal de Arte de Pekín, que ocupaba tres cuartas partes del museo y tenía previsto acabar en unos días. No me imagino que expondrán a continuación, pero deben rellenar casi todo el edificio. La colección perteneciente a la Bienal era muy interesante, con obras de artistas de todo el mundo y especialmente de China.\nAntiguo Observatorio de Pekín El Antiguo Observatorio de Pekín es una perla que, de nuevo, poca gente visita pero ahora las delicias de cualquier aficionado a la Astronomía. Es uno de los más antiguos del mundo, construido en el siglo XV por la dinastía Ming, y contiene aún varios instrumentos de precisión sobre una torre de 40 por 40 metros y quince metros de altura.\nAdemás de la torre y sus instrumentos, también puede visitarse una exposición sobre el uso de dichos instrumentos y personalidades importantes de China relacionadas con la Astronomía en toda la historia. Algunas de esas personalidades fueron europeos que viajaron en algún momento y decidieron quedarse a sacar partido a los medios que allí encontraban.\n Antiguo Observatorio de Pekín, con sus enormes esferas armilares, sextantes, azimuts, cuadrantes y esferas celestiales - CC License   Mercado de la Perla y Mercado de la Seda Breve comentario sobre estos dos mercados, seguramente los más populares para los tutistas a la hora de comprar. Siendo similares, me pareció que en el Mercado de la Seda había mejor mercancía. Los precios son parecidos y, siendo el regateo la base de todo, todo dependerá de lo apurados que estén los vendedores en el momento que llegues. Visité el Mercado de la Seda mi última tarde en Pekín y ya con cierta experiencia en estos mercados pude hacer varias compras interesantes.\nAutobuses enteros de turistas plagan estos dos centros y pocos salen con las manos vacías. Son los sitios donde las guías te dicen que puedes tomarte medidas para comprar un traje o camisas a medida muy baratas, pero no llegué a tanto por falta de necesidad e interés.\nEsto es todo, ¡Espero que hayáis disfrutado de la guía!\n",

    "title": "Tolkien 2019 in Birmingham",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Showing off my double nationality - CC License   If you are reading this you probably know already that I am a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, to the point that I joined the Spanish Tolkien Society (Sociedad Tolkien Española) almost 20 years ago and I usually don\u0026rsquo;t miss any of their events.\nSince recently I also belong to the Tolkien Society, and after having missed for probably important (but now forgotten) reasons Tolkien 2005 and Tolkien 2012, the last major events that they organized, I was not going to miss Tolkien 2019. In 2005 the gathering marked the 50th anniversary of the complete publication of The Lord of The Rings. In 2012 the conference was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Hobbit. This year the Tolkien Society celebrated in Birmingham its own 50th anniversary with the largest celebration of Tolkien ever held. More than 550 attendees and more than 150 activities including talks, panels, workshops, signing sessions, music, theater,\u0026hellip;\nI have a lot of things to do but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to write here some quick impressions of my experience there. (last minute edit: Quick is an euphemism, as I have spent several hours writing this article). Also, Pablo has published (in Spanish) a fantastic summary of his own experience in Tolkien 2019 and the scarce overlap between our experiences there has encouraged me to complete the article as much as possible.\nTL;DR: The good part: I attended around 40 activities, most of them top quality content, and I realize now that more than a third of them had a female speaker. That is a lot. I met in person lots of interesting people, and had the opportunity to spend time and learn from people that I admire. The bad part: I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the venue, the corridors were too small, it was full of steps and only two of the rooms were big enough for an event like this with \u0026gt;500 participants. The lack of a lunch break not only forced everyone to skip good contents, but also made it much more difficult to meet other people and do proper networking.\n The STE delegation with other friends from Spain also attending Tolkien 2019   Let me summarize some of the talks and activities I attended:\nActivities Heirs of Tolkien? The Major Contenders, by Tom Shippey\nThe opening keynote was delivered perfectly by Tom Shippey, it was the ideal kickoff for an event like this combining interesting facts and humor. I admire him since long time ago, but even more after having met him in person during the last XXIV Mereth Aderthad. Reading Beowulf together while drinking beer creates some bonding, who could have imagined it.\nShippey, with his usual simple (but effective) slides, started with the slogan of the Deustche Tolkien Gesellschaft: Ohne Tolkien, Keine Fantasy (without Tolkien, no fantasy) stressing how this motto is still correct nowadays. Tolkien was the first author to achieve mass market success with ambitious and top level quality high fantasy, something that was even more difficult in the previous century. Mass market success in fantasy works is more common nowadays, and this is only because of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s legacy.\nHe commented that he is working in a taxonomy of fantasy authors, and also explained who could be a worthy successor of Tolkien. In his opinion only three authors are candidates in quality with their own genuine style: George RR Martin, Stephen Donaldson and Michael Swanwick, all of them heavily influenced by Tolkien. This part was related to the talk he gave in May in Spain comparing the characters, works and values from Tolkien and Martin.\n Tom Shippey explaining the fantasy types identified by Farah Mendelsohn - CC License   To the origins of fairy-tales, by Enrico Spadaro (@EnricoSpadaro7)\nEnrico reminded us the relationship of Tolkien with fairy-tales, and explained the folklore tales that the Professor received as input for inspiration, being the most acknowledged of them the Kalevala. The speaker then explained that the Brothers Grimm or Charles Perrault were not the first ones to write fairy-tales in Europe, as there was an Italian author Giambattista Basile that was the first one (that we know) to include fairy-tales tales in Lo Cunto de Li Cunte. His tales included the first appearance of Cinderella, Rapunzel or the Sleeping Beauty.\nOn the nature and corporeality of Elves and Fairies according to Tolkien, by Massimiliano Izzo\nVery interesting and well documented talk, about how Tolkien speculated on the real nature of elves and how this vision evolved through his life. Metaphysical and sometimes even philosophical discussions that will deserve a quiet read when the proceedings are published.\nFour Brethren Heroes of the Gondolindrim - Egalmoth, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Legolas : A mythic and linguistic exploration, by Andrew Higgins (@asthiggins)\nAndrew Higgins explained very briefly how these four important characters are related to heroes from the Classical and Medieval works Tolkien could have known. He commented how Tolkien could have thought the names for each of them, linking as usual the meaning with the character. Again, it will be nice to read the final paper in the proceedings.\nTwo Realms: Finished and Unfinished Business, by Ted Nasmith\nThis was the first of many talks focusing on the illustration of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s works. This time, Ted Nasmith himself showed us some of his recent commissioned works related to Middle-earth and at the end also to The Song of Ice and Fire. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to articulate in words what he showed us: lots of illustrations including preliminary drafts or color tests that I would happily put in my walls.\nI specially liked a couple of his recent works: Rhosgobel, Durin’s Crown and the Mirrormere and most of all Turgon at Fingolfin’s Cairn. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind at all if someone wanted to buy me one.\nTed is not only a gifted artist but also proved to be friendly to his fans and methodical in his work.\n Ted Nasmith showing one of his awesome drawings of Treebeard - CC License   Leaf by Niggle, by Puppet State Theatre (@PuppetStateThtr)\nRichard Medringtone from the Puppet State Theatre showed us how one single person on stage can grab the attention of the audience for more than an hour. He is clearly a top professional in acting, and the adaptation of Leaf by Niggle fitted his style perfectly. The stage setting, despite being minimalistic, was adequate and the protagonist made good use of almost all its elements. I loved the play and will see it again without hesitation.\nClothing in Tolkien’s world and what we can see through its historical analysis, by Dr. Ester Torredelforth (@Torredelforth)\nEster, Doctor in medieval art and fashion, made a brilliant exposition of the facts that can be understood or extracted from the way Tolkien describes clothing details. Se used several designs prepared by herself to support her lecture, describing how Tolkien must have known with a decent level about medieval fashion and its utility and symbolism.\nAratalindalë - The Making of a Myth, by Maggie Percival\nI was not sure about this talk, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I finally attended it. The purpose of the lecture was to describe the process she and some other colleagues from the Tolkien Society followed to prepare the Masquerade for the London WorldCon of 2014 where they won several prizes including Best overall. They prepared a group costume entitled Aratalindalë that included eight Valar as they are described in The Silmarillion.\nMaggie explained with lots of details the reasoning after all the designs including the selection of fabrics and how they combined traditional dressmaking skills with modern technology using LED lights in the costumes with certain level of animation designed for each Vala. There are several pictures online but I haven\u0026rsquo;t found the full video where all the lighting features can be seen properly.\nTolkien and Italy, by Oronzo Cilli (@Tolkieniano)\nOronzo described his research about the relationship between Tolkien and Italy. He traveled there at least a couple of times and apparently there are several details that show he enjoyed and was influenced by the Italian culture. For example, it is known that Tolkien joined the Oxford Dante Society.\nTolkien\u0026rsquo;s Library, by Oronzo Cilli (@Tolkieniano) with Tom Shippey\nOne of the editorial releases of the year related to Tolkien studies and scholarship. The book is just a list of what could have been part of the Professor\u0026rsquo;s own library, and for each item Oronzo describes if the entry comes from a primary source, a secondary source, etc. Quite interesting if you are curious about the type of works Tolkien owned or had read. As new evidence appears, the list will have to be expanded with new entries.\nThe room was full also because Tom Shippey wrote the foreword and also participated in the lecture.\nFrance 1913. Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s first job, by Jose Manuel Ferrández Bru (@JosManuelFerrn1)\nMy colleague from the STE is becoming a regular for these types of events, and no wonder it\u0026rsquo;s like that with the quality and amount of research he has been doing over the last years. This time the lecture was about how a very young Tolkien got a job as tutor of a bunch of kids during a trip to France. Without spoiling the details, let\u0026rsquo;s say that the task was suddenly complicated and could have disrupted Tolkien in a unique way.\n Jose Manuel Ferrández Bru explaining the intricate relationships of the Martínez del Río Bermejillo brothers - CC License   The Two Towers of Birmingham, and other follies, by John Garth (@JohnGarthWriter)\nIt was believed that a couple of towers from Birmingham (Perrott\u0026rsquo;s Folly and the Edgbaston Waterworks tower) may have provided the inspiration for the Two Towers in the Lord of the Rings. John Garth started his keynote explaining why he does not consider this argument very solid. First of all, which two towers? Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith? Orthanc and Barad-dûr? It\u0026rsquo;s still ambiguous. Garth reviewed all the early designs that we have from Tolkien about those towers, analyzing the evolution of them.\nThe lecture also served somehow as a teaser for his next book, titled for the moment as Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Worlds.\nLOTR on Prime panel, by Shaun Gunner (@ShaunGunner) with Brian Sibley, Dimitra Fimi (@Dr_Dimitra_Fimi), Anke Eißmann (@khorazir), Jeremy Edmonds (@TolkienGuide) and Marcel Aubron-Bülles (@The_Tolkienist)\nThis panel was promising, first of all because the selection of participants was very well balanced with writers, scholars and artists offering different perspectives about their expectations. Of course they did not give any factual data, and probably that is the reason they were there in the panel giving their opinions freely and not Tom Shippey that is directly involved in the project.\nI specially liked the contributions by Brian Sibley, who was fully engaged in all the Peter Jackson films, and Anke Eißmann, who is eager like me to see in the new series a more daring production compared specially to The Hobbit films. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope they don\u0026rsquo;t try to imitate the style of Game of Thrones.\nAlan Lee\u0026rsquo;s Sketchbook, by Alan Lee (@AlanLee11225760)\nDespite the main room was completely full, the organization switched off the lights for the audience and everyone was in absolute silence listening to the careful explanations by Alan Lee. It was almost magical and completely amazing. We could see dozens of sketches explained from the genius himself, from watercolor exercises to architectural blueprints. Lee\u0026rsquo;s view on Middle-earth is engraved in the mind of many people (including mine) and we were very lucky that his vision was also omnipresent in Peter Jackson\u0026rsquo;s films.\nThere was also time for him to answer a lot of questions from the audience, and perhaps the most interesting were related to their relationship with other artists like John Howe.\n Alan Lee explaining one of his drawings about Orthanc - CC License   Orchestra Concert, by The People\u0026rsquo;s Orchestra (@ThePeoplesOrch)\nAfter enjoying a couple of beers in a nearby pub we came back for the concert, and we were very lucky as we were able to take seats in the front row just behind the Orchestra director. We were entertained not only with the soundtracks of all the LotR and The Hobbit movies, but also with several other compositions from our vast geek popular culture. Both the orchestra and its conductor demonstrated an impressive quality and charisma, one could see the effort to please the audience.\nThe People\u0026rsquo;s Orchestra is a charity apart from a standard symphony orchestra. They provide professional musical training and even work opportunities for unemployed people. Impressive.\nGrendel\u0026rsquo;s Mother and Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Women, by Jane Chance (@janegalv)\nThe speaker was humorous and kind with the audience, taking into account she delivered the talk without any kind of visual support very early on Friday morning. As the recognized expert in the field that she is, Jane spoke clearly and concisely about the role of Grendel\u0026rsquo;s Mother in Beowulf. After that, she managed to link the topic with the attitude of Tolkien about women in his professional academical experience. The talk was interesting but I could not connect some dots on the spot, hopefully I will with the proceedings.\nPauline Diana Baynes - An artists inspiration, by Jay Johnstone (@jaystolkien)\nAfter having met Jay in the Dealer\u0026rsquo;s Room and having enjoyed his own amazing pieces of art, I was curious about this talk. I expected him to explain not only his admiration for the artist but also his opinion as a passionate collector. I received what I expected, by far.\nPauline Baynes was a prolific and very special artist. She illustrated or contributed to more than 200 books, gaining international fame as the first illustrator and cover artist of some Tolkien minor works (Farmer Giles of Ham, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major, \u0026hellip;) and Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. As an example of masterpiece, the speaker showed us the illustration she did for a Nursery Rhymes book, in which she featured 56 different characters from the collected tales in one single page.\nI learned in the talk that Pauline illustrated Farmer Giles of Ham by pure chance, according to Jay Tolkien was visiting his editors to complain about the artwork proposal he had received and luckily a sketchbook by Pauline was open over a table.\nJay showed us some less known drawings and we were amazed both with the artwork and Jay\u0026rsquo;s explanations during the entire hour. He clearly infected me with his passion, I entered the room knowing Pauline Baynes only a little and left as a new declared fan.\nArtists in Middle-earth: illustrating The Lord of the Rings, by Marie Bretagnolle (@MarieBreta)\nThe abstract of the talk announced that Marie Bretagnolle was going to compare two of the most important British editions of The Lord of the Rings, also the only ones with commissioned illustrations inside. First the 1977 Folio Society edition, and the second by Alan Lee for the 1991-1992 Centenary edition.\nMarie delivered a clear and interesting talk, comparing the illustrations in both works and analyzing the importance of each drawing depending on the location. For example, the artist needs to take into account that an illustration that appears before the passage that is portrayed can provide inspiration for some readers but it can also work as a small spoiler for others.\nMaria is also to blame that I just spent a small fortune in the Folio Society website.\nThe source texts for Tove Jansson\u0026rsquo;s illustrations for The Hobbit, by Sonja Virta (@SonjaVirta)\nThird talk in a row about illustration. This time the content was focused on the controversially illustrated Swedish edition of The Hobbit in 1962. It was (or is) controversial for the somewhat gloomy tone of the drawings but specially because Tove Jansson presented Gollum as a huge moster. The speaker explained her thorough research on the topic, and the influence that the first Swedish translation of 1947 could have had in Tove Jansson for the 1962 edition.\nThe Shape of Water in Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Middle-earth, by Norbert Schürer\nAnother pleasant surprise, thanks to the good work of the speaker. Norbert explained with high detail the research he is doing about the influence of the water in Middle-earth. He started the paper after discovering that there was not a lot of scholar work about it, despite the water is omnipresent in The Lord of the Rings in all its forms/states: liquid, solid and gaseous. I\u0026rsquo;d add another shape to his list of occurrences: the absence of water. After all the tragic journey of Frodo and Sam towards Mount Doom, the absence of water is what finally makes them realize that there is no possible return.\nThe speaker described as well the taxonomy he is working on, based on the type of representation of the water in each moment: figurative, purely instrumental, only geographical and intentional. This is again a paper I will enjoy reading again once the proceedings are published.\nBilbo, Ulysses and the Greatness of the Unknown, by Gloria Larini\nBilbo and Ulysses, two great characters in two epic adventures. The speaker, taking advantage of her knowledge in Latin and Greek literature, compared both characters and how they embarked on their adventures. For example, both go for the unknown but the initial step is quite different. Ulysses has no choice but Bilbo on the contrary is suitable for the enterprise (at least according to Gandalf).\nAnother interesting difference between the stories is that Homer did not include the journeys in the narration, but Tolkien does.\nMemory, Lore, Knowledge, by Thomas Honegger\nAnother quite interesting talk. The speaker explained the concepts, remarking the difference that Tolkien made among them. For example, regarding memory we can find live memory (Gandalf, Galadriel, \u0026hellip;) and dormant memory (the ring verse, old Gondor lore). The main part of the talk was about the difference (almost opposition) between knowledge and lore. In Middle-earth, knowledge is perceived as negative (Saruman is the main representative) but Lore is usually positive (Ioreth, as the best example). Lore cannot be learned, it needs to be handed over or it will be lost. That is why knowledge can increase, but Lore can only decline.\nThe Hobbits and I: My Travels in Middle-earth, by Brian Sibley\nI knew Brian Sibley since long time ago, what I didn\u0026rsquo;t knew (shame on me) is that he is still an active tolkienist and such a prolific writer recently.\nThis keynote was merely self-biographical, as Brian explained in a careful and detailed way his career and complete evolution. He focused first on his biggest hit, the 1981 BBC radio dramatization of The Lord of the Rings, to finish with his recent projects including the chronicles of the making and movie guides of the two trilogies by Peter Jackson, the awesome The Maps of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Middle-earth book with John Howe and even an authorized biography of Peter Jackson.\n Brian Sibley showing the audience how he receive a book signed (and fixed) by Tolkien - CC License   \u0026lsquo;I met a lot of things on the way that astonished me\u0026rsquo;: Natural Growth in Writing The Lord of the Rings, by Christina Scull\nChristina Scull gave a nice lecture about the creative process of Tolkien. The quote in the title is from Tolkien himself in one of the letters, in which he explained how his own understanding of the characters was changing along the writing process. No surprises here, being Tolkien a huge perfectionist and having spent writing The Lord of the Rings more than 10 years.\nListening to Christina was a delight but for those that did not attend, calm down as it won\u0026rsquo;t change much respect reading the paper yourselves.\nBanquet\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say about the banquet, except that maybe in any hypothetical next event I will consider seriously not attending. We had a good time and it was fun, but it was due to my companions at the table. Being used to the STE gala dinners, I found this banquet insipid and uninteresting. I can live with only three brief toasts and no songs, but the self buffet format was annoying with some starting dinner while others had already finished\u0026hellip; it was almost impossible to interact with people from other tables. On top of all this, it was absurdly expensive even for UK standards.\nAnyway, I did like a gesture that I will try to copy in our Spanish association. During the banquet, probably the time with more people in the same place, they gave commemorative badges to those who have been members of the Tolkien Society for 10 (a splendid generation!) and 25 years. It is a recognition that is always welcome and appreciated.\nTen Years of Books in Tengwar, by Tsvetelina Krumova\nTsvetelina Krumova thinks that Tengwar should never be written by a machine, as it goes against its nature. According to this reasoning, that I fully share, she began 10 years ago to transcribe some books using Tengwar. She brought some copies to show us and the result is astonishing, even ignoring the infamous amount of hours this woman has spent writing. She also described how the activity itself of writing in Tengwar forces her to focus so much, that she is using this also as a kind of relaxing or meditation experience on a daily basis.\nI took another important thought of this talk. Despite the amount of pages and studies that we have today it is still not possible to cook like the elves, to fight like them or it is not clear how could we dance like the elves did. But we can write exactly like the elves, even if we need to write Tengwar in English or Spanish. Food for thought!\n One of the books written marvelously in Tengwar by Tsvetelina Krumova - CC License   Taniquetil: A tale of two cities, by Denis Bridoux\nI took some risk, choosing this talk instead of a Sword fighting showcase or a Dwarven Beard workshop, but now I know that I did right.\nAs Denis was researching on Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Taniquetil drawing for the Aubusson tapestry, he realized that there was a mystery to solve in the drawing. At the foot of the Holy Mountain, next to the coast, there are two very very small cities, so small that people usually don\u0026rsquo;t notice them. Would they be Tirion and Alqualondë? The descriptions in The Silmarillion don\u0026rsquo;t match adequately with the drawing, despite the low level of detail.\nIt started to make more sense when he noticed that the watercolor drawing by Tolkien is dated in 1925 when he had already written most of what was published as The Book of Lost Tales (written in 1916-1919 according to the speaker) but not yet the main contents of the Quenta Noldorinwa (written in 1930). This could explain how the drawing depicts more clearly a book that was, in fact, published later.\nAn Archaeology of Hope and Despair in the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen, by John Whitmire\nThis lecture presented the research that John Whitmire is doing, with permission from the Tolkien Estate, using the still unpublished materials in the Tolkien Collection of the Marquette University. His study is about the use of Hope and Despair (as absence of hope) centered in the Characters of Aragorn and Arwen.\nThe lecture, that will also deserve a slow read in the proceedings, described how he organized the contents in different strata or layers during his research according to the known archaeological practice.\n Stratum A is the tale \u0026ldquo;of Aragorn and Arwen\u0026rdquo; from the original manuscript Stratum B1, B2, B3,\u0026hellip; are the different revisions of the original manuscript Stratum C is the fair copy of the tale after all the B revisions Stratum D is a more refined version, where we find Ivorwen identifying Aragorn personally as hope and Elrond calling Aragorn directly Amir (that means hope) etc.  The Dim Echo of the Catcher, by Nils Ivar Agøy\nIn this lecture Nils, that receive during the banquet a badge for belonging to the TS since 25 years ago, describes his research about the connections between Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s comments on the Nodens Celtic deity and his own legendarium. It is known that the Professor studied about this, to the point he wrote a paper about the name of the Nodens deity and probably traveled several times to the excavations. The speaker described some parallelisms and the presence in The Silmarillion of mentions to a catcher or hunter deity. Interesting read.\nTolkien and His Publishers, by Wayne Hammond\nWayne Hammond with his wife Christina Scull are a reference about Tolkien and his work. They have published several key books about the art of Tolkien in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (that I eagerly possess) and the most important Reader\u0026rsquo;s Companion and Companion and Guide.\nThe speaker shared part of this vast knowledge, this time focusing on the relationship of the Professor with his publishers and editors. He told some anecdotes in an entertaining way, including a couple about Tolkien being famous among the publishers for making very slow progress. It was really interesting hearing his comments about the economic negotiations, in which Tolkien apparently was very successful as it is clear now, specially for his heirs.\nIllustrating Tolkien panel, by Shaun Gunner (@ShaunGunner) with Alan Lee (@AlanLee11225760), Anke Eißmann (@khorazir), Jenny Dolfen (@JennyDolfen), Ted Nasmith and Jay Johnstone (@jaystolkien)\nThis panel is another hardly repeatable thing that happened in Tolkien 2019. Only John Howe or the Hildebrandt Brothers could match them in quality and/or popularity. Shaun did a good job distributing his own questions and the ones from the public, so we could all enjoy an interesting session with genuine views and the most relevant opinions of the industry.\nTolkien and the Classics, by Claudio A. Testi with Tom Shippey and Thomas Honegger\nClaudio Testi, with the help of Honegger and Shippey, presented a new collection of essays that explore the relationship between the Professor and Classic authors. As they explained, the goal is not always to find connections where there are none but to do the exercise just to assess the result, as is usual in comparative literature.\nThe collection is organized in three sections:\n Tolkien and Authors from Antiquity Tolkien and Authors from the Middle Ages Tolkien and Authors from the Modern Period  Masquerade\nThe Masquerade itself was nice, with some great costumes and/or performances and the rest more or less fine. I have to say that the best part of the evening was during the interlude, when some organizers presented several performances. There were three of them, two portraying the Professor and another one about Sauron motivating his troops, that were hilarious. Sadly I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the names, sorry.\nThe parody of the BBC radio show Just a Minute was fine but maybe too long, but I understand that the format was perfect to allow waiting more or less time until the judges agreed the winners of the contest.\nThe result of the Masquerade contest is the least important thing, but I did not like that they gave prize to practically all but 2-3 participants. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would have been very difficult to give 2-3 more prizes and a weird situation (at least for me) would have been avoided.\nGeopolitics in Tolkien’s Works, by Lamont Colucci (@LamontColucci)\nAfter reading Colucci\u0026rsquo;s bio I was curious about the talk. I have to say that my worst fears were fulfilled and in the end the talk was 75% a generic International Relations lecture with a not very subtle American imperialism tone, and 25% how geopolitics and strategy reflect in Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s works. He stressed that in Middle-earth wars are never won with magic, they are always won or lost with medieval style war tactics and strategies that apparently Tolkien understood and was able to articulate.\nColucci gave us interesting quotes like \u0026ldquo;as Americans we feel that we are Gondor, keeping other actors like The Shire in peace\u0026rdquo; followed by another statement about the willingness of the US to prevent Russian invasions to Sweden despite the Swedish do not want to belong to NATO.\nGandalf for President: the Politics of Tolkien, by Shaun Gunner (@ShaunGunner)\nSecond lecture of the day about politics, that also left me with bittersweet feelings. Shaun, current chair of the Tolkien Society, explained what could be the political inclination of Tolkien based on what we know about him and his context. Based on his research he claimed that Tolkien was in favor of the Scottish independent movement despite feeling proud of his country and idealizing England as The Shire. According to Shaun, the Professor was against all kinds of communism or imperialism, to the point that the idealistic Shire was a Benevolent Anarchy with the Thain acting just as a ceremonial figure without real authority.\nThe speaker also tried to explain why Tolkien is beloved by millions of people from the whole political spectrum. Related to this, he also said that the Tolkien Society was created in the sixties to claim Tolkien back from the hippies.\nPower and Choice in the Second Age: A Political Primer, by Sarah Rachel Westvik\nLuckily this third talk was not as opinionated as the two previous ones. The speaker, a student of International Relations, analyzed all the political context and tensions that we can see in the Second Age. She grouped the explanation in realms to cover Númenor, the Elven kingdoms (Lindon, Eregion and Greenwood), Mordor and the Ainur. Nice presentation from an eloquent speaker.\nFive or Six Ponies?, by Jessica Yates\n A plan of the house of Crickhollow, by Jessica Yates - CC License   The premise of the talk was intriguing. In the 2004-2005 revision of The Lord of the Rings, the editors changed Merry\u0026rsquo;s line: \u0026ldquo;There are six ponies in a stable across the fields\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;There are five ponies\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. The reasoning for the change was that the original six ponies were for five hobbits plus a pack-pony, assuming that when Tolkien reduced the number of adventurers to four, he forgot to alter that line. Apparently there has been some debate about this change, and Jessica researched as much as she could to solve the mystery.\nAs part of her research, Jessica draw (and shared copies with the audience) a plan of the house of Crickhollow. I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil the surprise, if you want to know the answer wait for the proceedings.\nTolkien, Folklore, and Foxes: a thoroughly vulpine talk in which there may be singing!, by Dr Dimitra Fimi (@Dr_Dimitra_Fimi)\nShippey\u0026rsquo;s was probably the best opening keynote and undoubtedly this was the perfect closing keynote. Dr Dimitra Fimi taught us and entertained us smartly and passionately.\nThe keynote started remembering the audience about the Rhyme of the Troll, the verses that Sam sung to the rest of the fellowship when they encountered Bilbo\u0026rsquo;s trolls. Dimitra didn\u0026rsquo;t just remind us about the song, she sang and encouraged the audience to sing, so we sung. It was fun and easy.\nThen she reminded us that the rhyme is based on a traditional English folk song called The Fox. She encouraged the audience again, and the audience carried it out enthusiastically.\nBut obviously a folklore song was not written in our English. She researched further until she got the original lyrics in Middle English. As you can imagine Dimitra no longer had to ask us to sing, although this time not everyone could pronounce properly but that was not important. Try to imagine a room with 400-500 people of an average above 40 years singing in Middle English. We only lacked a beer in the hand.\nThere is no better way to finish this article than with a recording of Tolkien himself singing the Rhyme of the Troll. If you are still here, please enjoy:\n  “Rhyme of the Troll” Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,\nAnd munched and mumbled a bare old bone;\nFor many a year he had gnawed it near,\nFor meat was hard to come by.\nDone by! Gum by!\nIn a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,\nAnd meat was hard to come by.\nUp came Tom with his big boots on.\nSaid he to Troll: ‘Pray, what is yon?\nFor it looks like the shin o’ my nuncle Tim,\nAs should be a-lyin’ in graveyard.\nCaveyard! Paveyard!\nThis many a year has Tim been gone,\nAnd I thought he were lyin’ in graveyard.’\n‘My lad,’ said Troll, ‘this bone I stole.\nBut what be bones that lie in a hole?\nThy nuncle was dead as a lump o’lead,\nAfore I found his shinbone.\nTinbone! Thinbone!\nHe can spare a share for a poor old troll,\nFor he don’t need his shinbone.’\nSaid Tom: ‘I don’t see why the likes o’ thee\nWithout axin’ leave should go makin’ free\nWith the shank or the shin o’ my father’s kin;\nSo hand the old bone over!\nRover! Trover!\nThough dead he be, it belongs to he;\nSo hand the old bone over!’\n‘For a couple o’ pins,’ says Troll, and grins,\n‘I’ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.\nA bit o’ fresh meat will go down sweet!\nI’ll try my teeth on thee now.\nHee now! See now!\nI’m tired o’ gnawing old bones and skins;\nI’ve a mind to dine on thee now.’\nBut just as he thought his dinner was caught,\nHe found his hands had hold of naught.\nBefore he could mind, Tom slipped behind\nAnd gave him the boot to larn him.\nWarn him! Darn him!\nA bump o’ the boot on the seat, Tom thought,\nWould be the way to larn him.\nBut harder than stone is the flesh and bone\nOf a troll that sits in the hills alone.\nAs well set your boot to the mountain’s root,\nFor the seat of a troll don’t feel it.\nPeel it! Heal it!\nOld troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan.\nAnd he knew his toes could feel it.\nTom’s leg is game, since home he came,\nAnd his bootless foot is lasting lame;\nBut Troll don’t care, and he’s still there\nWith the bone he boned from its owner.\nDoner! Boner!\nTroll’s old seat is still the same,\nAnd the bone he boned from its owner!  See you in the next Tolkien gathering!!\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": " Greach 2019   This week I could attend another fantastic Greach Conference, an international conference that in previous years was focused on the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem (Grails, Gradle, etc.) but this year has expanded the scope to other technologies related to the JVM like Micronaut, GraalVM, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Android, \u0026hellip;\nGreach is a non-profitable event held in Madrid since 2011 (I think I\u0026rsquo;ve missed only one edition). This year for the first time the organizers were Sergio del Amo y José Miguel Rodríguez, with some help from colleagues and a lot of sponsors.\nTLDR; The conference was, as expected, great both in content and speakers. It\u0026rsquo;s a must for me, specially being held here in Madrid. This is still a Groovy lovers conference, but this year Micronaut was omnipresent. Some speakers also put the focus on GraalVM and Kotlin as technologies to follow closely. I will.\nLet me summarize some of the talks I attended:\nTalks JVM Frameworks Keynote, by Andrés Almiray (@aalmiray)\nAndrés gave an interesting overview of the JVM Frameworks ecosystem, starting with some history. He reminded us all when Struts was the king of the hill, and how it surrendered to Rails, Grails, etc. The microservices appeared and the frameworks evolved as well. Spring Boot has been the dominant player for a while but everything changed last year with the appearance of Micronaut. Others are following the same approach, like RedHat with Quarkus.\nA perfect kick-off for a conference centered on frameworks.\n Andrés Almiray with a microservices frameworks taxonomy - CC License   Micronaut State of the Union, by Graeme Rocher (@graemerocher)\nGraeme gave an overview of the features and roadmap for Micronaut. He highlighted several times that it is perfect for Microservices and serverless functions, but not only for them as it\u0026rsquo;s also suitable for bigger applications. The goal of Graeme and his team is to break the correlation between lines of code and startup time and resources consumption. He also emphasized their fight against reflection and the consequent reflective data caches, essential in other frameworks like Spring Boot, that have several inconveniences in performance and start up time.\nHe also explained why Micronaut behaves amazingly good with GraalVM, but clarified that they are mainly focused on the performance with the standard JVM that most people still use. He ended with an interesting live demo about the Bean Introspection API, released with the last 1.1 version.\n Graeme Rocher explaining Java\u0026#39;s problems for Frameworks - CC License   Boosting your applications with distributed caches/datagrids, by Katia Aresti (@karesti)\nKatia explained how Infinispan works as a cache or data grid, both as a library or as a external service, and how to configure it in distributed systems. With examples using Harry Potter (sometimes confusing) analogies she also explained concepts like redundant replication or consistent hashing. She finished with a demo using Infinispan, Eclipse Vert.X and Quarkus.\nReactive for the Impatient, by Mary Grygleski (@mgrygles)\nMary explained what reactive programming is and gave an overview of the the current Java options for this. She spent most of the time with the theoretical basics and terminology to finish with a quick overview of the main alternatives. I\u0026rsquo;d have preferred more details or examples in the last part, as I am already familiar with the basic concepts, but the talk was overall useful and interesting.\nGraalVM with Groovy \u0026amp; Kotlin, by Alberto de Ávila (@alberto_deavila)\nAlberto explained how to use GraalVM, the architecture basics (the GraalVM compiler, the Truffle API, etc.), and how to use Groovy and Kotlin with it. It was an interesting and well documented analysis, focusing on the current limitations and the potential benefits. It\u0026rsquo;s quite promising despite GraalVM is still far from being production ready.\n Alberto de Ávila explains the GraalVM Architecture - CC License   Accelerating CI, by Felipe Fernández (@felipefzdz)\nFelipe\u0026rsquo;s talk was quite interesting. As a Gradle Enterprise developer he explained basic and advanced recommendations in order to achieve a faster and more reliable CI. He explained how to parallelize workers, how to design an effective pipeline structure and how to avoid maintenance waste in general. He ended with a couple of very good recommendations: measure everything and treat your CI as code, always.\nGrails State of the Union, by Graeme Rocher (@graemerocher)\nAnother interesting status review of Grails by Graeme. This time it was focused on how Grails is already benefiting from Micronaut, and how to take advantage of those benefits using Grails. He encouraged all the Grails plugin developers to migrate them to Micronaut so they can be used not only from Grails but also in other use cases.\n Graeme Rocher explains the differences between Micronaut and Grails - CC License   What\u0026rsquo;s new in Asciidoctor, by Schalk Cronjé (@ysb33r)\nMy first choice on Saturday morning was to learn all the new things that Asciidoctor is introducing. Schalk explained clearly lots of new features, making everything much more simple and intuitive. Curiously, Schalk released during the conference version 2.0.0 of the Asciidoctor Gradle plugin, written entirely in Groovy.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not using Asciidoctor enough lately and I regret it, as it\u0026rsquo;s fantastic.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new in Gradle 5?, by Andrés Almiray (@aalmiray)\nAndrés summarized all the new things that are coming with Gradle 5.0, highlighting Kotlin DSL 1.0 integration for those who are ready to use it. Gradle 5.0 will have better dependency management and several build performance improvements related to composite builds, build cache management and build scans. He even demoed some of the features, I specially liked how the Gradle build scans functionality looks like.\nCreating Micronaut Configurations, by Iván López (@ilopmar)\nThis year Iván was not organizing the conference, he even had time to attend lots of talks, but he delivered as usual one of the most useful talks. He reviewed how Micronaut configurations work and explained in detail how to create a new one. There are several different options to extend the framework via configurations and looks quite easy.\n(Automated) Security Testing in a DevOps world, by Kevin Wittek (@kiview)\nThis was one of the most interesting talks of the conference, at least for me. Kevin explained very clearly how to evolve from the traditional development pipeline to a more DevOps oriented one. Apart from some general recommendations he described all the possible security checks and validations that can be done, when and how to do them. He also created awareness about the lack of an open source reliable catalog of known vulnerabilities.\n Kevin Wittek with a Linus Torvalds quote - CC License   Micronaut performance, by Miguel Ángel García Gómez (@MiguelAngelGG82)\nMiguel Ángel showed a comparison he made in terms of performance between the main microservice-oriented frameworks that we have now in the market: Micronaut, Spring Boot and Vert.x. He added a fourth option (Micronaut running on GraalVM) although he confessed that he could not measure everything properly with it due to the lack of compatibility between GraalVM and Prometheus.\nHe showed the audience the results of his benchmark. The overall winner is apparently Micronaut+GraalVM despite the uncertainty related to the lack of good measurements. Among the other three options, some of them are better in some tests, but none of them is clearly better. Perhaps with larger and/or more challenging benchmarks the degradation in any option(s) could make the difference.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bird, it\u0026rsquo;s a plane, no it\u0026rsquo;s SDKMAN!, by Marco Vermeulen (@marc0der)\nMarco, creator of this awesome SDK manager tool, explained the current status of SDKMAN and the next features. He also explained the architecture behind the project, and the main challenges it faces. He also made some very interesting comments about the initial decision to write it in bash to have only curl and zip as dependencies, and how he is now considering a rewrite in a different language.\nHow I Automated My Barn with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Mongo and the Cloud, by Todd Sharp (@recursivecodes)\nMy Greach conference ended with an interesting talk by Todd Sharp. He explained how he managed to create a complex combination of technologies to learn about them and also about some features of the Oracle Cloud offering. He lives in a small town and has a barn with a pig and some chickens, so he wanted to automatize as much as possible the repetitive tasks related to the barn. He started with some sensors and now he is in the way to not only read but also perform some actions like fill a water bowl, open/close the doors or detect predators in the surroundings.\nHe was very funny and, although the demo didn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly work and made him lose some time, he could explain the complexness of what he built and the technologies he learned in the process.\n Todd Sharp explains the architecture of his barn automation project - CC License   And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Greach 2020 !!\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "My Saturday finished having a great dinner with friends and lots of laughs in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels.\n FOSDEM 2019 poster   As usual, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early. Lot\u0026rsquo;s of things to see in a complete set of new devrooms/tracks. This year I focused my second day in the Community and Geospatial devrooms.\nBefore continuing, if you want to read my summary of the previous day you can follow this link: FOSDEM 2019: Saturday. You will also find there general info and details about the event itself.\nAgain, I will summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):\nTalks Supporting FOSS Community Members with Impostor Syndrome, by Sage Sharp\nThe purpose of the speaker was to share advice and tips about how to support people who experience impostor syndrome, focusing on people from underrepresented groups. Sage gave a quick introduction to the concept to go then directly to the topic. I received several good recommendations: normalize questions, how to give praise, what deserves praise, etc.\nWe have seen lately lots of talks about the syndrome itself, it\u0026rsquo;s quite good to hear about how to counter it efficiently. As the speaker said, we as technical and resourceful people, should be able to improve this.\nCompanies and Communities, Why Can\u0026rsquo;t We All Just Get Along?, by Deb Nicholson and Nithya Ruff\nCompanies and Communities have different systems of rewards and penalties. Companies focus on single minded views, and the alignment to the goals is rewarded. Communities focus on personal motivation, even if it\u0026rsquo;s something that is not profitable or even shippable in the short term. Companies fire people and people leave companies normally against the will of the employer, but in communities everyone leaves voluntarily and usually they can return happily.\nDiversity is good in both worlds, to have it and to show it. The speakers gave a very good advice to companies, recommending to send diverse people also to events and conferences, not always the same group of people. Respect also is essential both to a Community norms or a Company culture, this could be enforced in both worlds with a good Code of Conduct.\nAnother very interesting and useful talk, describing the differences between these two worlds, and how can they benefit reciprocally.\nThe Open Source Community: its past and future, by Nick Vidal\nOpen Source is more than everything a continuum, it has been with us for more than 20 years now and it will hopefully stay around many more. In the last years we have celebrated the 20th and even 25th birthday of lots of projects: Debian, Redhat, FreeBSD, \u0026hellip; The speaker summarized the history of Open Source, starting with its definition, highlighting the recent complicated stories in Redis or MongoDB.\nThe historical overview was great, but I particularly appreciated a message about Open Source being based on the gift economy, with gifts far beyond code like openness, freedom and community.\n FOSDEM 2019 - Nick Vidal reviewing the Open Source history - CC License   Continuous Integration to compile and test Navit, by\tPatrick Höhn\nIt was great to learn about Navit (a complete car navigation system with its own routing engine), but regardless the project itself the speaker gave great recommendations to improve the Infrastructure aspect of an Open Source project. Infra is usually a challenge in FOSS projects, as most contributors are interested in the project and not the infra part. Resources are needed to host any service, and those resources require funds.\nThere are several continuous integration platform that offer a free tier for FOSS projects, including platform specific tests and static code analysis. There are also good alternatives for Device Farming and GUI( testing frameworks.\nLinking OpenStreetMap and Wikidata, by Edward Betts\nOne of my favorite talks of FOSDEM 2019, not only because the talk was clear and useful but also because the project behind is a perfect example of a pet project that becomes larger and larger as the main contributor starts discovering additional potential. The current status is awesome and the future looks even better.\nEdward Betts has created OSM \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Wikidata matcher, a powerful tool to link OpenStreetMap data with Wikidata articles (a Wikimedia tool with structured data). There are several benefits for doing this, being the main ones having labels in more languages, OSM data linked to more wikipedia articles and Wikimedia Commons. The tool is not fully automated to avoid false positives being linked, but the tool provides a great assistance.\nAs an active Supper Mapper and software engineer, I should start doing tools like this. Most of my edits in OSM are totally manual and for some use cases the impact is much more important when you automatize to make more efficient the time that you are contributing. In the short term, I will consider contributing as much as I can to this project.\nGraphHopper Routing Engine - New Features, by Peter Karich\nPeter gave a nice and clear presentation about GraphHopper, a powerful and fast Java library and web service for routing. The speaker explained the last improvements in the tool, as well as in the routing algorithms they use: Dijkstra, A*, Landmarks and Contraction Hierarchies. The talk included several demos calculating very quickly continental scale routes very fast and efficiently, including alternative routes.\nHikar - Augmented reality for hikers, by Nick Whitelegg\nAnother awesome project I discovered in FOSDEM. Nick explained the current status related to geospatial Augmented Reality (AR), tools are scarce and normally closed-source so he, as a developer and hiker, thought about a free tool to cover this gap: Hikar. It is an FOSS Android app aimed for outdoor and geographic AR, that overlays footpaths from OpenStreetMap on the camera feed and generates virtual signposts with relevant POIs around the user.\nThe talk described the technical complexities, the data related issues (elevation is critical) and problems related to the realism of the path and signpost placing. Very interesting and inspiring talk.\n FOSDEM 2019 - Nick Whitelegg presenting Hikar - CC License   Hundred thousand rides a day, by Ilya Zverev\nI already attended and reviewed a talk by Ilya Zverev last year and I enjoyed it, and it was worthy again this year. Ilya explained how he is improving the routing algorithms of his current employer and at the same time he is detecting and fixing problems in OpenStreetMap. The main problem for OSM are sources, there are not so many (because of licensing problems) and they get old, so using only certain sources means that we are mapping the reality of yesterday instead of the world as of Today.\nHe created a set of tools to validate calculated routes, comparing them to the actual traject of the drivers. Using a basic code of colors is easy to check what streets are used in what direction, what turns are abnormally avoided, etc. With this tool, they can notice very fast changes like blocked roads with constructions or reversed streets (temporal or definitive). In order to have reliable data the tracks are as fresh as possible.\n FOSDEM 2019 - Ilya Zverev with a visualization of gpx tracks in different colors depending on the angle - CC License   He gave some ideas for himself or for others to start similar projects: checking highway classification, missing turn restrictions, speed limits, etc.\nOpen Source Geolocation, by Zeeshan Ali\nZeeshan explained the history of GeoClue, an open source geolocation service for GNU/Linux. The talk was focused on the main challenges they faced and how they addressed the privacy issues related to share the users\u0026rsquo; location with other applications.\nOpenStreetMap for emergency prep: The view from San Francisco, by Stefano Maffulli\nStefano moved to San Francisco some years ago with his wife, and they were scared about the next earthquake. The found there a lot of people with the same concerns and some organizations providing support for this. For example the Neighborhood Emergency Response Team (NERT), a group of civilians that take lessons from the fire fighters about how to spot and use water hydrants or police call boxes, to locate the nearest hospitals or schools, or to avoid places with hazardous materials like car repair shops, construction sites or gas stations.\nThey used OpenStreetMap as the base for emergency related preparations, as almost everything is mapped or can be mapped in OSM.They improved the map data related to the Emergency Response tasks using trained NERT volunteers, so they could even research the most and lest vulnerable neighborhoods in the city. They are now adding additional features related to other catastrophes like heat or cold waves.\n FOSDEM 2019 - Stefano Maffulli presenting his OSM based project for emergency preparation - CC License   Very interesting project, even for non preppers.\nOpenTrailView 360, FOSS StreetView for hikers, by Nick Whitelegg\nNick again on stage to explain another interesting project, OpenTrailView 360 a FOSS StreetView application for hikers. He explained how the tool started in 2010, the problems he faced to gather proper images and how he resumed the project in 2013 when the Sphere pictures appeared in Android phones and this last version (OTV 360) born in 2018 after the appearance of affordable 360 degree cameras.\nNick explained the challenges he faced and the tools he could use from the FOSS community: Mapillary for street-level imagery, GeoJSON Path Finder for client-side in-browser routing, and Pannellum to display the panoramas in the browser. The demo that Nick showed us was very promising, another project to follow closely.\n2019 - Fifty years of Unix and Linux advances, by Jon \u0026lsquo;maddog\u0026rsquo; Hall\nThe closing keynote was delivered by Jon \u0026lsquo;maddog\u0026rsquo; Hall, a software and hardware freedom advocate, developer since 1969 and the current Board Chair of the Linux Professional Institute.\n2019 not only marks the 50th anniversary of Unix, but also the 50th of the ArpaNet/Internet and the Apollo 11 Moon landing. \u0026lsquo;maddog\u0026rsquo; summarized the evolution of Unix, Linux and the Free Software movement in those 50 years in a hilarious but interesting way. A packed full Janson auditorium enjoyed the jokes a lot, so it was a great way to to compensate the sadness of leaving FOSDEM again.\n FOSDEM 2019 - Jon \u0026#39;maddog\u0026#39; Hall in the closing keynote - CC License   And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Brussels in 2020 for the 20th anniversary of FOSDEM!!\n",

    "body": "It has been a week since I returned from another intense and thought-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. This year, apart from attending FOSDEM (as I intend to do every year) I took a very early flight on Friday to visit new (for me) places in the city. In just one day I visited the European Parliament Hemicycle, the House of European History, the Parlamentarium and the Museum of Natural Sciences. My most productive Friday in months, for sure.\n FOSDEM 2019 poster   For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know FOSDEM, it is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to Open Source development and communities. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) ecosystem. It\u0026rsquo;s also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with names and faces you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.\nI already wrote about it in previous years:\n FOSDEM 2016: Friday, Saturday and Sunday FOSDEM 2018: Saturday and Sunday  The numbers of this 2019 edition speak for themselves, improving all the figures from 2018:\n more than 8,000 attendees in only two days 730 speakers in 788 different events (talks or workshops, mainly) 63 tracks in 47 different rooms more than 400 hours of content, almost all of the events are available online with live streaming during the conference 65 stands of all kinds of projects: FSFE, Python Software Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, OSI, the Eclipse Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy, O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Debian KDE, Gnome, LibreOffice, VideoLAN, Mozilla, \u0026hellip;  To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is organized by volunteers, everything is community driven and it\u0026rsquo;s free to attend. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to register beforehand.\n FOSDEM 2019   As usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):\nTalks Can Anyone Live in Full Software Freedom Today?, by Bradley M. Kuhn and Karen Sandler\nBradley and Karen are the President and the Executive Director respectively of Software Freedom Conservancy. They focused on people like themselves (and me) that seek to use only free software in our daily tasks, and the compromises that we sometimes need to do in order to achieve certain goals.\nKaren explained her concern when she had to put herself an implantable defibrillator with proprietary code inside, with no access to the code even if the manufacturer somehow recognized that it could cause trouble for pregnant women because their algorithms were not properly tined for that situations. She had to suffer some unnecessary electrical shocks during her pregnancy and could not do anything about it. Another common example they gave is about modern websites that force the users to activate JavaScript in order to load in your device complete applications with proprietary software on it.\nSome use cases for the general public have several free alternatives but for others there is no alternative so the users are forced to use privative applications. The main call to action of this keynote was for all the open source developers to re-think and re-prioritize our collaborations to close this gap and improve our general freedom.\nThis was a good opening keynote, although knowing very well the speakers since a long time ago I expected more explicit suggestions (or accusations).\nFLOSS, the Internet and the Future, by\tMitchell Baker\nMitchell, Executive Chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation, insisted in her keynote on some of the key messages from the previous one. She explained how a handful of organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) are a clear threat to privacy and openness despite having their core codebase full of FLOSS software.\nShe showed some of the projects that Mozilla is offering to increase the privacy rights of the users, for example the Facebook Container extension that isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web so they are not able to track you everywhere.\nShe also commented an experiment, trying to track every advertisement that appears in the web to see who is paying for that ad (someone is paying, always) and why this ad is being showed to you. Is it because I\u0026rsquo;m a man? Is it because of my age? Is it because of some specific behavior?\nThe keynote ended with some comments about the Addition Economy that rules the world in which we live and the effort that is still needed to fight against hate and violence in social networks. She explained how the rejection of those problems is part of the DNA of the FLOSS communities, and how we need to translate those values to the society using handy and attractive tools for users.\n The classic OpenSUSE beer - CC License   Blockchain: The Ethical Considerations, by Deb Nicholson\nWe hear a lot that Blockchain is the future but what kind of world do we want to see blockchain make? We no longer live in a world where we can forget or ignore the consequences and the social impact of our work. Deb explained some of the most controversial aspects of this technology:\n Do the upsides (transparency, distributed control, etc.) compensate the downsides? Will Blockchain just make the richest people richer? If not all the contracting parties understand or can even read the contract\u0026hellip; is it legitimate enough? What will happen if a corporation or group of them owns the majority of the nodes? Can we maintain this using just solar powered energy?  Mattermost’s Approach to Layered Extensibility in Open Source, by Corey Hulen\nCorey, CTO and co-founder of Mattermost, explained how their platform enables extensibility by their users. He claimed that almost 100% of what you see in the UI is accessible via standard REST API calls. Another important aspect to enable extensibility is that the complete data model is open enabling easy load, extraction and manipulation. Client side customizations for the interfaces, extensible APIs, incoming and outgoing webhooks and powerful plugins.\nI expected more architectural contents but the talk was clear and very detailed so I learned a couple of nice concepts anyway.\nGDPR and the right to data portability, by Laurent Chemla\nThe right to data portability was intended as a way to enforce competition and to give back to the public some control over their personal data, but it fails in both situations. The regulation does not include a standard implementation or interface so everyone is dealing with this in a different way.\nSome of the usual suspects (Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft among others) created in 2017 the Data Transfer Project (DTP) to create an open-source data portability platform, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time for a public and central organization to take over the project in order to set it as a global standard.\nEnough: How journalism can benefit from free software, by Veronika Nad\nEnough is a set of tools, cloud-based or self-hosted, as well as a community composed of technical people and journalists to empower journalists and Human Rights Defenders when protecting their privacy and their sources.\nIt provides an easy to use platform for non technical people to securely share any kind of data, typically a leak for a global audience. It is linkable from other platforms to serve as a common source, making it possible for anyone to communicate (if needed) securely and confidentially with the source of the data leak. It also includes training contents to teach the participants how to use PGP, TOR, VPNs and similar stuff.\nI will consider contributing to the platform, at least to improve the website they have using Hugo.\nThe clusterfuck hidden in the Kubernetes code base, by Kris Nova\nI am not a Kubernetes expert but I learned a lot in this talk. The speaker explained in a pleasant and concise way all the anti-patterns that are present in the Kubernetes code base.\nJava Language Futures, by Brian Goetz\nBrian Goetz, Java Language Architect, explained in a fast but clear way all the new features that are coming to the Java Language. He briefly explained the new release cadence (releases every 6 months), project Amber, Valhalla, Loom or Panama to focus later into the details of some relevant improvements.\nI want to highlight the enhancements in the switch (preview feature for v12), patten matching and value types.\nOpenJDK Governing Board Q\u0026amp;A, by Mark Reinhold, Georges Saab, Doug Lea, John Duimovich and Andrew Haley\nAs usual in FOSDEM, the complete OpenJDK Governing Board offered themselves for an open Q\u0026amp;A session. Georges Saab (Chair, Oracle), John Duimovich (Vice Chair, IBM), Mark Reinhold (OpenJDK Lead, Oracle), Prof. Doug Lea (SUNY Oswego) and Andrew Haley (Red Hat) kindly answered all the questions from the audience.\nI will summarize my Sunday experience in FOSDEM as soon as possible, but this article is already long enough to be published.\nStay tuned!!!\n",

    "body": "Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the previous year. I have been doing this since 2011 in Spanish, but this time I will do it in English as with the rest of my posts. You can read about my previous years (in Spanish):\n 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011  Evolution of my game plays over the last years   2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Total since 2006   Total amount of plays 101 84 98 84 81 117 161 1039   Different games played 61 72 55 71 52 81 80 397   Games with 2 or more plays (in the year) 14 9 15 13 14 19 40 175   Amount of gaming sessions 43 36 35 30 44 41 36 365    Games played per year until the end of 2018   Analysis  In this yearly post I used to include a graph with the games played by month, but it turned more or less complex and meaningless as the trend was clear year by year. I tend to play more or less the same along the year with some peaks in the gaming conventions. In 2018 I went back to the 2016 numbers in amount of plays, with a higher amount of different games played. I\u0026rsquo;ve played 61 different games this year, 41 of them were totally new (to me). A very high proportion. I recorded 43 gaming sessions, almost 4 per month. Again, in 2018 I have zero hours recorded in the Steam platform. I miss it and I will give it some priority in 2019. My h-index as a player is still at 11. Reading carefully the data, I expect to go up at least one level in the next period, as I have several games near the h-index frontier.  Retrospective  I still enjoy a lot playing boardgames, role playing games and video games so I will keep this as one of my main leisure activities for 2019 In January 2018 we finished Pandemic Legacy Season 1 the campaign we started back in 2016, but after that I haven\u0026rsquo;t played any other legacy game. I still love cooperative games and I would not reject starting one with a stable playing group, maybe the recently announced Journeys in the Middle Earth? I am becoming addicted to escape room inspired board games. In 2018 I have played several Unlock! and Exit and for 2019 my goal is to play all the published games of those two families I managed (with my party and DM) to maintain since March a monthly Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons 5th Edition campaign, and I only missed one session because of a trip. That is very good news for me and for the entire group, we are enjoying it a lot so we will hopefully continue with the same frequency and passion. I\u0026rsquo;m still eager to play prototypes, but since early 2018 I am no longer a member of Asociación Ludo. I was not involved at all so, although I miss some of my colleagues there, I decided to leave after realizing that the association does not benefit from me if I\u0026rsquo;m only providing economic support. I will consider returning when I\u0026rsquo;m capable of offering more :-(  ",

    "title": "The German Romantische Strasse",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend Agatha, this time through the German Romantische Strasse. It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through Scotland, Austria, Brittany or Normandy (and we have made a few more).\nI\u0026rsquo;m adding the German adjective to the title because last year I also traveled through the Austrian Romantikstrasse. We discovered after that trip that a similar one existed in Germany, so it was about time to travel the german one at least to compare. For your information, there are similar routes in Japan, Korea and Brazil. I neither confirm nor deny that now I want to follow those as well (damn completism).\nI really needed some holidays to disconnect (this year has been difficult and complex in several ways) and I love to travel in December through central Europe to feel their passion for the X-Mas season and the mulled wine or glühwein as they call it. Sadly we couldn\u0026rsquo;t plan a lot in advance (again) but we could at least prepare a draft planning of the places we wanted to visit in those eleven days. We planned (and booked) a couple of days for Dachau and Nuremberg at the beginning of the trip and some days in Munich at the end, 2-4 days depending on the required time for our main priority: The Romantische Strasse.\nMap from the official website: 29 towns in 460 kilometers  In 11 days I drove 1.035 kilometers, we visited 20 towns/cities, I took almost 1.200 photos and we found 30 caches!!\nLet me summarize our experience in the main stops of the trip. Let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nDachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site After having visited Auschwitz and Mauthausen more or less recently, I was not as impressed as others can be with Dachau but that is only my bias, because Dachau Memorial clearly is worth of a visit.\nThe preserved part of the original camp is minimum, so the special attractive of Dachau for me was the permanent exhibition located in the former maintenance building, the biggest standing building from the original camp. The explanation about what Dachau was, how it worked and its role in the overall strategy of the Nazis is quite detailed and interesting. They were so proud of the (awful) results that they exported it to other concentration camps as the Dachau model.\nAt the end of the original concentration camp there are several religious temples of different religious faiths. Some of them were closed but in the end they mainly aim at religious people from that specific faith. Nothing to do with the spectacular memorials in Mauthausen, for example.\nDachau - Memorial sculpture by Nandor Glid erected in 1968  Nuremberg We spent almost 1,5 days in Nuremberg, a wonderful place that exceeded my expectations (and they were high). Everything was invaded by tourists because of the seasonal stuff so we happily joined the flock and we walked calmly through all the X-Mas Market stalls, with special attention to the Glühwein ones. We walked a lot through the city center and I loved almost everything that we saw: the Henkersteg (Hangman\u0026rsquo;s Bridge), the Maxbrücke, the Ehekarussell, the Handwerkerhof (Craftmen\u0026rsquo;s Courtyard) and lots of other beautiful streets and buildings. The only locations that we visited properly were the Imperial Castle and the Toy Museum.\nThe Toy Museum would be interesting just for the fact of having an entire building packed full with toys (some of them new but mostly vintage). Children will enjoy it but also adults of all ages, going through several cabinets of what could have been their toys. One section was entitled for the evolution of the toy concept, where they emphasized the current phenomenon with children flooded by short-lived play stuff, often endangering their creative playing skills. An interesting thought that I mostly share.\nThe Imperial Castle is probably the main attraction in Nuremberg. As almost everything else it was vastly destroyed in the II World War but they successfully rebuilt the entire complex as it was before the war. The exhibition is quite interesting, combining clear explanations of the elements of the Castle in their historical context with information about the Holy Roman Empire and the role of the city in that late Middle Ages. I still raise my eyebrows remembering the visit to the Tiefer Brunnen (The Deep Well), you should not miss it.\nHaupmarkt and the Frauenkirche of Nuremberg in X-Mas time  I loved to see Nuremberg in X-Mas but I will try to visit again in another season as there is a lot more to see.\nWürzburg In Würzburg we repeated the tactic. We arrived in the evening to see the city after dawn, and in the next morning we visited the main attraction: the Würzburg Residence, a clear masterwork of German Baroque.\nWürzburg Residence main entrance  Here we found again some of the places closed (some of them closed for the entire winter) but in overall the town looked fantastic and also worth for another visit at least to see the Gardens and the Marienberg Fortress (that was closed for the entire Winter).\nTauberbischofsheim After leaving Würzburg we made a quick stop in Tauberbischofsheim. We could just visit the Saint Martin church as the rest was closed for the winter, but the visit was worthy anyway. The medieval old town is fantastic and very well preserved, including an interesting Neo-Gothic town hall. We left after a quiet meal watching an intense rain fall through the windows.\nTauberbischofsheim Market Place panoramic  Bad Mergentheim We left Bad Mergentheim after one evening and part of the next morning without been able to visit the Castle of the Teutonic Order and the Teutonic Order Museum but in overall it was again a nice visit because the old town was splendid, specially with the seasonal lights and stalls. The heavy rain continued so we had little more to do.\nWeikersheim Weikersheim was one of the biggest surprises of the trip. The old town was also cute, but I want to highlight the Weikersheim Castle, a fabulous Renaissance palace with Baroque gardens.\nThe 40 meters long Knights\u0026rsquo; Hall at the Palace is the most astounding thing that I have seen in ages. It is dedicated to hunting and secret worlds, and any visitor will be amazed by dozens of life-size three-dimensional figures of wildlife animals made in painted stucco, mostly of those that could be hunted in the surroundings but also including exotic pieces like an elephant. The wooden ceiling is also entirely covered with pictures of hunting scenes mixed with local legends. A unique place.\nStatue from the Dwarf Gallery in the Weikersheim Castle  We enjoyed a lot the Castle, if any of the other places that we found closed are similar the Romantische Strasse will clearly worth a second visit.\nWe also visited the Sternwarte Weikersheim Observatory, just in case it was open, but we were unlucky again.\nRöttingen Röttingen was another quick visit before lunch. Their well preserved medieval fortifications and old town deserved a visit. The Brattenstein Castle looked nice, it was closed but we could at least see that it also serves as a small open air theater. Another interesting place in seasons with better weather conditions.\nWe also discovered a sun-dial hike trail around the town, with a different type of sun-dial in each stop. Nice also for longer stays.\nRothenburg ob der Tauber Rothenburg ob der Tauber was probably the town that I enjoyed the most from the entire Romantische Strasse. It does not have an iconic place (like a fine Palace or a landmark Castle) but the entire old town is somehow magical. The battlements that surround its huge medieval center can be traversed (and we did it) for a length of 2.5 km, allowing anyone to surround from the heights almost the complete perimeter.\nWe only visited one Museum out of pure curiosity, the German Christmas Museum. The Museum itself is interesting but not an unforgettable place, but the free-entry Christmas decoration shop behind (or around) it is completely amazing and singular. In fact, the Museum is inside this huge shop that belongs to a famous German company that sells Christmas decorations in several stores across Germany and in some other locations worldwide. This one is the head office and it is open all year long, claiming to have the world\u0026rsquo;s largest selection of traditional Christmas ornaments. It totally deserves a visit, if you are disciplined and you can resist the temptation to buy things like crazy.\nDuring the highly advisable Night Watchman walking tour we heard some interesting stories. One of them caught my attention so I will summarize it for you, after having confirmed its authenticity. March 1945, II World War is about to end but some German soldiers are barricaded here taking advantage of the huge city wall. Lots of bombs are dropped killing dozens of people and destroying \u0026gt;300 buildings, several watchtowers and part of the wall. In that moment the U.S. Assistant Secretary of War, John J. McCloy, knowing (allegedly) about the beauty of Rothenburg orders to stop immediately the artillery attacks and gives three hours to a small group of American soldiers to negotiate the surrender of the town, or it will be bombed massively. At that moment in time Rothenburg was not as touristic as it is today and it was pure luck (almost miracle, according to the watchman) that the mother of Mr McCloy had a painting of the town at home that the Assistant Secretary of War had seen several times as a child, hearing wonderful stories about the place. The local Nazi commander, agreeing on the importance of preserving the city, betrayed Hitler\u0026rsquo;s direct orders and committed treason surrendering the city. Since November 1948 McCloy is also honorary citizen of Rothenburg.\nThe Watchman gave us also another thought provoking insight: Rothenburg was severely depopulated in the 17th century by the Thirty Years\u0026rsquo; War and a bubonic plague outbreak and its economy was a mess during a couple of centuries. It was not until the end of the 19th century when several artists from the german Romanticism visited the place with the first tourists and some regulations were created to prevent major changes in the old town. In some way, as he told us thankfully, all the current economic wealth is thanks to a long lasting extreme poverty that preserved the 16th-17th century state.\nI really need to stop writing about this place if I want to finish this chronicle, but before going to the next one let me show you the most picturesque, photographed and painted place in Rothenburg.\nThe most picturesque, photographed and painted place in Rothenburg ob der Tauber  Dinkelsbühl We stopped at Dinkelsbühl during the lunch time, in order to eat something nice there and apparently we made a usual plan, according to the huge amount of restaurants that Dinkelsbühl has. After lunch we made a nice walking tour though the city center with some daylight surrounding the whole town center inside and outside the city wall.\nThere are interesting places to see/visit here like a 3rd Dimension Museum but my suggestion is to at least walk calmly through it, passing through some of the splendid gates of the wall: the Wörnitz gate, the Segringen gate, the Nördlingen gate or the Rothenburg gate to name the most beautiful ones.\nOne of the nicest streets in Dinkelsbühl  Nördlingen We arrived in Nördlingen in the evening, so again we walked through it at night, to enjoy the seasonal decoration and the X-Mas Market delicacies, and we walked it again calmly in the following morning.\nAgain, as in Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg ob der Tauber, this is the third fully walkable battlements that can be traversed (the only three in Germany) surrounding, in this case for more than 2.5 km, an almost perfectly preserved medieval town center. I suppose that reading this summary it all sounds quite similar but in reality each town had its own personality and touch, so our visits were not overlapping with the previous ones but adding a lot to a great overall experience.\nThe amazing battlements of Nördlingen  The city was built in the middle of a meteorite impact crater, so they have the the Rieskrater Museum dedicated to the crater explaining some geological facts. Another important museum in Nördlingen is the Bayerische Eisenbahnmuseum with more than one hundred original railway vehicles. We could not visit them but for a longer stay here they are quite interesting.\nAugsburg We spent the rest of the morning in Donauwörth (nice but nothing remarkable) to finally arrive in Augsburg again in the late afternoon.\nAugsburg was for me, undoubtedly, one of the most special stages of the trip. The seasonal markets were again everywhere with a noticeable quality in the products and decorations, even in the Glühwein (I plead guilty of tasting them all) and the city itself is gloriously beautiful. Lots of buildings and scenes breath history through their doors and walls.\nAgain, we could not visit everything we wanted (for example the Mozart House, where the composer\u0026rsquo;s father Leopold was born and the musician visited several times) but the places we visited were amazing. The Maximilian Museum of decorative arts was remarkable, the Cathedral was nice but the most clear must see of the town is the Goldener Saal (Golden Hall) in the Town Hall, a \u0026gt;550 square meters hall with large murals and numerous ceiling paintings all of them richly adorned with golden frames and decoration. Astonishing. During the visit we learned that it was badly damaged during the II World War and it was renovated and redecorated between the 80s and 90s, according to historical photographs and blueprints.\nIn the shiny Goldener Saal (Golden Hall) of Augsburg  Landsberg am Lech Landsberg am Lech was a last minute addition to our trip. We initially discarded it but we finally went there and we did not regret at all. It is a small town, with little to see apart from its nice streets but at least I wanted to visit in person a picturesque tower that is located there: the Mutterturm.\nWhat we found was a lively town center with several people enjoying the X-Mas market delicacies (yes, lots of Glühwein again) that forced us to extend our stay. In our way back from the car, after putting a new parking ticket, a fabulous sunset with a bright rainbow totally surprised us. A perfect spot with the perfect timing.\nSunset panoramic of Landsberg am Lech, the rainbow appeared later  Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau Castles The municipality of Schwangau would not be a stop on any route if it were not for the two wonders that it has in its touristic suburb of Hohenschwangau: the Hohenschwangau Castle and specially the Neuschwanstein Castle.\nwith the fabulous Neuschwanstein Castle behind  The Neuschwanstein Castle is one of those worldwide known locations capable itself of receiving millions of visitors from all around the globe. According to Wikipedia, more than 1.3 million people visit the castle annually making it one of the most visited places in the world. I\u0026rsquo;m not surprised, especially after having visited the Castle personally.\nVisiting Neuschwanstein is a comfortable and amazing experience. Our german friends have managed to allow its thousands of daily visitors to enjoy the castle without queues, almost without big crowds and without being shoved. In order to do this you just need to book your ticket in advance for a very specific day and time (they claim that you will not be able to enter if you arrive slightly late), as the castle can only be visited with a guided tour that lasts about 40-45 minutes.\nAs an alternative, and that is what we did, you can always go to the official ticket center in Hohenschwangau to buy a ticket for any tour with available capacity for that the same day. We took the risk, arriving the ticket center almost an hour before the opening time, and the plan worked perfectly. With only a dozen of people in front of us (maybe a hundred behind when the doors opened) we were able to get the tickets we wanted for both castles at the most appropriate time slots for us.\nBut there are thousands of pages and books about the place and the logistics, so let me focus again in my experience there.\nNeuschwanstein is the perfect climax for the Romantische Strasse. It is an incredible combination of the best architectural techniques and craftsmanship with the overflowing imagination of the most creative artists of that time. The overall theme are the operas of Richard Wagner based as well normally on medieval legends: The Ring of the Nibelung, Tristan and Isolda or Parsifal among others. As you probably know the castle was commissioned (and paid out of his personal fortune) by King Ludwig II of Bavaria that was admirer and later friend and (so they say) even lover of Wagner himself.\nI left the castle, after the non-stopping breathtaking tour, with the feeling that everything was perfectly located, designed, painted or illuminated, to the smallest detail. If at some point I become a millionaire, and that is difficult because I do not steal neither play any lottery, I think I will build a similar castle themed in fantastic genre legends. Dreams are cheap.\nBonus recommendation: Even if you hike to the castle don\u0026rsquo;t forget to go further up to the Marienbrücke, a spectacular steel bridge (originally made of wood) that crosses a huge gorge from where you will have the best perspective of the castle. The bus that takes you to the castle for non-hikers has its closest stop to the castle near the bridge.\nPanoramic of the Neuschwanstein Castle as seen from Marienbrücke  Hohenschwangau Castle is a 19th century palace built by King Maximilian II of Bavaria, and childhood residence of his famous son King Ludwig II. According to the Wikipedia, Hohenschwangau has 300k visitors per year, far away from the astounding numbers of Neuschwanstein. It\u0026rsquo;s clearly not as spectacular but having visited the location it does not make sense to me that 75% of the visitors leave Hohenschwangau without visiting this second marvel.\nHohenschwangau Castle from below  You can also (and probably should) visit the Museum of the Bavarian Kings. It is nothing compared to the Castles but will give you more insights and an interesting context if you visit it before going to the Castles. Also, you don\u0026rsquo;t book any specific hour to see it so you can use any free time slot during the day to go, quite convenient.\nMunich I will be very brief, because this post is already too long and also because I am quite sure that I will go back sooner than later for a detailed visit because I loved the city.\nThe famous Town Hall of Munich surrounded by X-Mas  Munich, the famous capital of Bavaria, could not and did not disappoint us. It has a well deserved appreciation from tourists, and during the X-Mas it is perhaps more remarkable because it is one of the most popular Christmas destinations in the region, along with Nuremberg. Again, we could not visit some of the main attractions but visited some amazing places and we enjoyed ourselves strolling though its streets and X-Mas market stalls.\nUpon arrival we visit the Nymphenburg Palace, a wonderful Baroque palace surrounded by a huge garden in which we could only see a corner. It was raining and sometimes snowing during our visit so the garden will probably be also my first visit if I go back again to Munich during the sunny part of the year.\nThe Palace served as Summer Residence for the Bavarian royal family for centuries, King Ludwig II was born there in August 1845. The visit is really worth it as you can enjoy several rooms and pavilions with lots of artworks and rich decoration. My favorite attraction there was the Gallerie of Beauties of King Ludwig I, a set of really nice portraits by the same painter (Joseph Karl Stieler) on behalf of the king to 36 beautiful women from all social classes of Munich. The audio guide described the best-known works with all the relevant context but a few others made me curious, maybe one day I will research more about it.\nWe also wanted to see at least one of the many important art galleries of the city, and I think it was a great choice to visit the Alte Pinakothek. The Old Picture Gallery name refers to the time period covered by the collection, as they also have the Neue Pinakothek nearby. I was amazed by many great painters, most of them new to me: Carl Spitzweg, Gabriel von Max, Walter Crane, David Wilkie, Ludwig Richter or Johan Christian Dahl to name just a few.\nI could not remember all those names to the point that after visiting the museum I made the complete tour again very very quickly taking photos of the pictures and the inscription plates of my favorite ones to discover more at home. I made it walking very fast, almost running, so even a nice elder man stopped me to say: \u0026ldquo;see, they sell the collection catalog in the shop so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to picture everything and leave if you are in a hurry\u0026rdquo;, I explained him that it was my second round and that I was in love with the museum and we laughed for a while.\nBonus recommendation: Do not visit this museum without using the audio guide, it was one of the best ones I have ever used. Not only they described the masterworks, they did it with nice music along with the texts and sometimes mixed with stories that gave a complete new meaning to the picture. At least the one in English, I always use the English one as sometimes it is more carefully prepared or detailed.\nThe other remarkable and marvelous location that we visited was the Munich Residenz, the larges city palace in Germany where you can visit more than 130 rooms and pavilions. It is impressive not only because of the size but also because of the importance and beauty of the collection. Many things to highlight: The Hall of Antiquities, the Ancestral Gallery, the Grottenhof, the Royal Apartments, the Golden Hall,\u0026hellip;\nA complete panoramic of the Munich Residenz Antiquarium  As my twitter followers know (more details in this thread), we had an unspeakable amount of Glühwein during this trip. They served it always and everywhere in ceramic or crystal mugs, avoiding the usage of non re-usable cups that normally end up in the floor or overflowing trash cans. They charged a 3-4 € deposit so you were also free to keep it as a souvenir. Furthermore, in each town (and in the bigger towns even in each market stall) they served the mulled wine in a different mug, some of them nicer than others. We were tempted to keep all of them, but it was not scalable (neither in money nor in luggage requirements) so finally I just kept three from my favorite towns of the trip: Nuremberg, Augsburg and Munich:\nThree Glühwein mugs from my favorite towns of the trip: Nuremberg, Augsburg and Munich  And that is all!! I hope that you enjoyed the guide!\n",

    "body": "I was eager to introduce this section on this site for a long time, after seeing it on my favorite travel blog: Dendarii.es, written by my dearest Yami. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s about travels since I enjoy more and more traveling and reviewing my trips.\nMy Curriculum Vitae as a traveler contains two main parts:\n A Leaflet map with all my visited countries with a link to the review that I could have written here in the blog. A chronological list of all the trips that I have made (as far as I remember)  Looks like I\u0026rsquo;ve visited 18 out of 193 countries (among those recognized by United Nations), almost all of them in Europe. Looks like the time has come to expand the range of my trips.\nCopying the model in dendarii.es to this blog took about 10 minutes. Updating it with my trips took a few hours (researching in calendars, several digital photo albums and even Google Maps Timeline) but the greatest effort (at least in time) has been the aesthetic redesign. I could have left the styles as they were but I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the result.\nI hope you like it, you will always find a link to it in the header.\n",

    "title": "Scotland: a brief opinionated guide",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make an awesome road trip through Scotland with my friend Agatha, my travel companion lately. You can read about our trips together through Austria, Brittany or Normandy.\nIt was my second time in Scotland, after a great trip three years ago to visit mainly Edinburgh. So, this time the Scottish capital was discarded as a destination and the goal was to visit as much as possible of the rest of this beautiful country.\nIn six days we drove around a thousand miles and hiked almost 40 kilometers, without taking into account the countless walks through cities and towns. And we found more than 25 caches!!\nWhat to expect from this guide Again (and it\u0026rsquo;s starting to be an issue) we had to prepare the trip in just a few days. Some places were more or less familiar to me and for years I\u0026rsquo;ve had a terrible desire to visit the Isle of Skye, but apart from that all the initial research was full of positive surprises.\nLet me show you the initial map of Scotland must visit destinations prepared by Agatha, except the Isle of Skye prepared by myself. Sadly we couldn\u0026rsquo;t visit all of those places because we decided to do as much hiking as possible and we took it very easy in general, but we managed to visit almost all of them.\nMap with the main places to visit in Scotland, mainly prepared by Agatha  Let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nDay 1: Loch Lomond National Park, Puck\u0026rsquo;s Glen \u0026amp; Oban We landed at Glasgow International Airport very very soon to make the most out of the first day. We lost some of this advantage struggling with the car rental company. In the end the experience with them was OK but it started horribly bad. They gave us a car smaller than expected (and booked, and payed) but at least it had automatic transmission and in the end it was comfortable enough for two and very appropriate and comfortable to drive on normally one lane roads.\nOur tiny Huyndai i10 - CC BY-NC-SA  Our first destination was Balloch, on the southern shore of the beautiful Loch Lomond, the largest inland stretch of water in Great Britain by surface area. We visited the castle gardens and walked through the main road (including our first beers of the trip, mine without alcohol). Balloch is a popular destination because lots of ferries leave from there to navigate the lake. The only ship that we boarded was The Maid of the Loch, a beautiful paddle steamer (the last to be built in Britain) that is coupled to the pier and serves nowadays as a cafeteria. Apparently is being restored by a charity whose aim is to return her into operation again.\nThe next stop was Luss, a touristic small town a few kilometers up the lake shore. The center of the town was very beautiful, specially the surroundings of the Parish church, but there was a disproportionate amount of tourists. Before leaving we had a nice lunch in a quaint restaurant, including the best chicken chipotle wrap that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten. Seriously.\nAfter another nice drive through a marvelous countryside we arrived to the starting point of Puck\u0026rsquo;s Glen, probably the most beautiful walking trail that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. Puck\u0026rsquo;s Glen is amazing, the pictures cannot capture the atmosphere in the whole place. Looks like it\u0026rsquo;s named after the character of William Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s play A Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream and it surely resembles a fantastic dream: huge trees, dense forests, breathtaking viewpoints, uncountable water streams, picturesque water falls, steep ravines,\u0026hellip; The hike is not very long and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to follow so you should not miss it if you come near the area.\nPuck's Glen, a real midsummer night's dream - CC BY-NC-SA  We finished our first stage near Oban, a beautiful resort town surrounding a nice bay. It has a curious monument on top of a hill, McCraig\u0026rsquo;s Tower, and lots of restaurants and hotels. Despite this, we chose a promising Bed and Breakfast in a town nearby.\nA nice panoramic of Oban, with a blue McCraig's Tower on top - CC BY-NC-SA  Bonus recommendation: the Grove House Bed and Breakfast exceeded all our expectations. They were extremely nice with us (including waiting until late for the check-in), giving us two rooms for the same price so we could sleep more comfortably. In the morning I took one my favorite breakfasts in the UK: smoked herring grilled.\nDay 2: Beinn Lora, Glen Coe, Loch Ness \u0026amp; Eilean Donan After the energetic breakfast, the first thing we did was another small hike, the Eagle\u0026rsquo;s Eyrie walk in Beinn Lora. The path had been recently improved by the logging company that exploits the area and it was very beautiful and interesting. Not so many days before everything was covered by huge trees but when we were visited only some remaining lumber and stumps were there. In some stumps we counted more than 60 rings, the entire area produced mixed feelings of sadness and beauty. Very curious, after all.\nBeinn Lora, nature alive and dead at the same time - CC BY-NC-SA  Some kilometers up north we arrived the main attraction of the day: the Glen Coe National Natural Reserve, one of the most popular Natural Reserves in the UK. We visited the Meeting of the Three Waters and the Three Sisters, totally different things but separated by less than 1 kilometer. Despite the light rain, we decided to start climbing the Bidean nam Bian mountain massif to reach the Coire Gabhail, also known as Lost Valley or Hidden Valley because in order to reach this glacier formed marvel you need to climb 230 meters through a steep path. The ascension was fantastic and beautiful, but also very long and quite adventurous because the rain became more intense and the path was steep and wet. We were always safe but we ended up very tired and soaked after almost 5 hours under the heavy rain. It was totally worth it, anyway.\nSoaked but happy, entering the Lost Valley at Glen Coe - CC BY-NC-SA  After a well deserved lunch at the Boots Bar in the Clachaig Inn, we decided to spend the evening with more relaxed visits, the first of them to Fort Augustus, a small village in the south west end of Loch Ness. It is very popular for tourists but the main attraction is the lake itself. We took the car again to reach the ruins of Urquhart Castle, but it was closed already so we couldn\u0026rsquo;t even enter. I visited it in my previous trip to Scotland, but at least Agatha could see the ruins with the lake behind and Nessie diving somewhere..\nThe rain continued and the sunset was approaching, so for the rest of our evening we left a quick stop at the Eilean Donan Castle. The castle has an interesting history but it\u0026rsquo;s private and it was closed, so we just crossed the bridge and walked around it calmly to enjoy the place as we were completely alone.\nThe majestic Eilean Donan Castle - CC BY-NC-SA  Day 3: Isle of Skye We visited some of the main landmarks and popular hikes in the Isle of Skye. The fields in some areas were more brown than green, but the place is marvelous anyway. I want to go back, nut with more time and a mobile home.\nOur first stop was to climb to the Old Man of Storr, a picturesque 28 meters high pinnacle surrounded by similar rock structures. Compared to the previous days with the entire paths for us, in this route we met many more people. The parking site was packed full, even in the shoulders of the road, and the complete path was full of people going up and down. Nevertheless, the climb is beautiful and not very hard, so it\u0026rsquo;s a strong recommendation.\nA small lagoon beside the Old Man of Storr, with the sea behind - CC BY-NC-SA  After lunch, we make a quick stop to see the Mealt Falls, the Loch Mealt overflowing to the sea almost directly on a cliff. Interesting.\nOur next stop was poorly planned and fatally executed, everything because of me. There are several ways to visit The Quiraing and I choose the worst one starting with the most difficult part, a very steep ascension with lots of mud and puddles. The idea was that the rest of the way would be to descend from there, but the path was not easy even after having passed the worst slopes. A Storm suddenly appeared, we had only a few hours of light and we didn\u0026rsquo;t risk it. After going down to the parking lot, attempting the shortest and easiest path to The Quiraing was not appealing so we went to the next stop.\nFairy Glen is a special and curious place to visit. It\u0026rsquo;s a small area formed by small magical hills eroded in spiral-ish waves. To the natural attractive the locals have added more spirals in the ground made with stones and towers of stone in equilibrium.\nThe magical hills of Fairy Glen - CC BY-NC-SA  After a long drive we arrived before the sunset to the Neis Point, the most westerly point of the Isle. There is a beautiful walk from the car park to the lighthouse, including an interesting ascension to a small summit where you can (supposedly) see whales, dolphins and sharks. But you don\u0026rsquo;t need to climb anything to enjoy a spectacular sunset from almost anywhere in the point. You should go there definitely.\nThe walk to the lighthouse at Neis Point - CC BY-NC-SA  As we couldn\u0026rsquo;t book anything more or less affordable in the entire area, we changed our plans and decided to drive a couple of hours after dinner to sleep closer to our next destination outside of Skye instead of spending one additional day around there. We probably made a mistake because with the hotel booked far far away and just after starting the trip, it began to rain torrentially. Our GPS\u0026rsquo;s two hours estimation was transformed into almost 4 hours driving under the rain, at night, mostly through 1-lane roads and after a long day driving and hiking. But we arrived, luckily without running over any wild animal.\nBonus recommendation: Near the Rubha nam Brathairean on our way to The Quiraing we ate in the Skye Pie Cafe, a cute place with a vegetarian friendly menu that serves mainly pies of spectacular flavors based on local products, including some sweet pies for dessert.\nDay 4: Corrieshalloch Gorge, Rogie Falls, Cromatry, Fortrose \u0026amp; Inverness After a nice breakfast we started again very early our day. Lots of things to see!!\nThe first stop was a quick visit to the Corrieshalloch Gorge, a spectacular 1.5km long and 60 meters deep gorge with a huge waterfall and a bridge that only supports the weight of 6 people. We suffered a fun moment being there making pictures with other 5 adults when a family with a big dog appeared at the other end :-)\nA curious 'dancing' bridge to cross the Corrieshalloch Gorge - CC BY-NC-SA  A few kilometers later we stopped for another short forest walk to visit the Rogie Falls, a series of waterfalls that we could enjoy almost for ourselves. We enjoyed it so much that we had time to make funny pictures while looking for a cache.\nTaking a nap in Rogie Falls - CC BY-NC-SA  Three more stops: Cromatry, an interesting small village with a nice port; the Fortrose Cathedral, a half-ruined cathedral build primarily with red sandstone; and the Channonry Point, a spit of land near Fortrose that is very popular because from there you can spot bottlenose dolphins, porpoises and grey seals.\nAnd finally we arrived to Inverness, the capital of the Scottish Highlands. We spent the rest of the day there, looking for caches, walking around and enjoying the pubs. According to Wikipedia Inverness is one of Europe\u0026rsquo;s fastest growing cities, and it\u0026rsquo;s ranked very high in quality of life and happiest place in the entire UK, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any of this. Anyway, it can be a special place to live but IMHO it\u0026rsquo;s not so special for a tourist. The castle and the town hall are nice but I would not have minded having skipped this stop.\nSleeping in the worst hotel that I remember did not improve my general feeling about Inverness.\nDay 5: Cawdor Castle, Glenfiddich distillery, Cairngorms National Park \u0026amp; Pilotchry Our first day started with a nice visit to Cawdor Castle, a private castle that can be partially visited. It contains a nice collection of art and it\u0026rsquo;s richly decorated but what I loved most was the gardens. They even had a garden maze, but sadly the path to the interior of the maze was closed.\nThe gardens of Cawdor Castle, with the main building behind - CC BY-NC-SA  Neither Agatha nor I are big whiskey fans, but we did not want to leave Scotland without stopping in a distillery and we chose one of the most famous: Glenfiddich Distillery. I tried to convince her to go to Laphroaig distillery but it\u0026rsquo;s far away from everything else so I accepted the change.\nGlenfiddich has a huge distillery in Dufftown, they offer all kind of tours and most of the tours include a whiskey tasting at the end. For the designated drivers they offered a small bottle of Glenfiddich 15 to make the tasting at home.\nThe visit was interesting, after having visited some distilleries and several beer breweries what I needed was to learn something new or different related to the process. This time I learned that the shape of the swan necked copper stills affects the flavor, character and strength of the resulting whiskey. Brilliant, right?\nThe beautiful copper stills of the Glenfiddich Distillery - CC BY-NC-SA  We considered visiting also the Strathisla Distillery in Keith as the oldest continuously operating distillery in Scotland, but we decided to start going south to spend the afternoon in the Cairngorms National Park.\nAfter some research in the copilot seat Agatha chose the Loch an Eilein hike, a beautiful 7-8 kilometer walk around the said Loch. The entire route is astounding, including an idyllic view of a small island near the shore with an ruined castle. The best part was that we were almost alone in the entire area, more silence and quietness is impossible.\nCalmly enjoying the Loch an Eilein - CC BY-NC-SA  We finished our day with another short walk to view the Falls of Bruar just before sunset and a nice dinner in Pilotchry, one of the most touristic towns in the area.\nBonus recommendation: Although they made a mistake in the order and they took almost an hour to serve us our dinner, you should consider visiting McKays, a lively pub, hotel and restaurant with live music and nice decoration. We were seated in a saloon with the ceiling full of golf clubs and golf-themed pictures on the walls. We had dinner in front of Ballesteros and Olazabal :-)\nDay 6: Killin, Trossachs, Doune Castle, Stirling \u0026amp; Glasgow Our first visit, near our hotel with views to Loch Earn, was to see the Falls of Dochart. These broad falls are formed at the junction of two rivers, just beside an old stone bridge at the entrance of Killin. Quite a spectacular view.\nPanoramic of the Falls of Dochart, in Killin - CC BY-NC-SA  Also spectacular was to drive through the Great Trossachs Forest and the Duke\u0026rsquo;s Pass. For my next visit I must spend more time in this area.\nAfter a quick shopping stop and ordinary lunch in Aberfoyle we arrived to another of the places I wanted to go since my last trip to Scotland: the Doune Castle, a medieval stronghold that is famous because several scenes of Monty Python and the Holy Grail were filmed there.\nAs a huge fan of Monty Python I was curious about the place, and specially (I recognize it) about the merchandising that they could sell in the castle shop. We finally didn\u0026rsquo;t visit the interior of the castle to have more time in Stirling, and the merchandising in the shop was a bit limited (a few t-shirts, mugs and books) but the visit was worth it because Doune is close to Stirling so we didn\u0026rsquo;t spend a lot of time.\nEmulating King Arthur, at Doune Castle - CC BY-NC-SA  We arrived to the Stirling Castle with the full afternoon available to enjoy it calmly. It remind me (no surprises here) to the Edinburgh Castle and during our visit with the audio guide I tried to compare what I remembered from the other one. We could visit the place with less tourists that expected so it was more or less quick so we also spent some time walking through the Stirling town to grab a fantastic multi-cache with interesting stops: the Old Grammar School, Argyll\u0026rsquo;s Lodging, Mar\u0026rsquo;s Wark, the Church of the Holy Rude, the Old Town Jail or the Merkat Cross.\nThe day was cloudy, and from the castle the views of the National Wallace Monument were astonishing, even more than from behind the monument itself.\nViews from Stirling Castle, with the Wallace Monument in the background - CC BY-NC-SA  After enjoying Stirling, we arrived with the last sun rays to Glasgow. We walked the downtown, surprised by the huge amount of bars and restaurants. We knew that Glasgow had a good atmosphere but it seemed disproportionate to us in a positive way.\nBut our flight was scheduled to take off very very early, so to avoid last minute issues and traffic jams we returned the car and booked a hotel beside the airport. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll consider spending a full evening in Glasgow if I fly there.\nI hope that you enjoyed the guide!\n",

    "body": " Greach 2018   Some days ago I attended as usual to the fantastic Greach Conference, an international conference about the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem: Groovy, Grails, Gradle and a lot other things. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it\u0026rsquo;s surely one of the Top worldwide events about this technologies.\nGreach is a non-profitable event organized by Iván López (@ilopar) and Alberto Vilches (@albertovilches), with some help from colleagues and a lot of sponsors.\nTLDR; The conference content and speakers were great, in addition to the logistics. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend the workshop day (my fault), and it was a pity specially because this year I had paid for it. Apart from learning (as usual), this year was specially exciting with the worldwide announcement of Micronaut.\nLet me summarize some of the talks I attended:\nTalks Groovy Keynote: 2.5+ Roadmap, by Paul King (@paulk_asert)\nPaul King, Groovy Technical Lead at OCI, gave a good overview on the status and roadmap of the Apache Groovy language. Paul summarized the features announced for Groovy 2.5 (GA expected Q2 2018) and Groovy 2.6 / 3.0 (RC end of 2018). Apart from more (and better) AST transformations, Groovy 2.6 / 3.0 version will come with the brand new Parrot parser that brings several improvements and better Java syntax support for a lot of use cases.\nFirst keynote in @greachconf by Paul King @paulk_asert about Groovy 2.5 and the roadmap to come #greach18 pic.twitter.com/Js8uUadgcG\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) March 16, 2018  Building DSL using Groovy, by Puneet Behl (@puneetbhl)\nPuneet, Software Engineer at OCI, started with a brief introduction to DSLs, for those who are not familiar with them. He focused on the advantages of the DSLs in some use cases, allowing the Domain experts to help, validate and even code DSL expressions. After that, he showed with some examples how to create a DSL language with Groovy. The talk was nice but probably he could\u0026rsquo;ve made the assumption that everyone in Greach knows Groovy basics or what a DSL is.\n. @puneetbhl explaining the pros and cons of DSLs #greach18 pic.twitter.com/00fNDGhD8i\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) March 16, 2018  I’ve seen Grails code you wouldn’t believe…, by Iván López (@ilopmar)\nIván made, as usual, a well prepared an amusing talk about some mistakes that he has seen in the recent months in several Groovy projects. Names were changed and the code was partially blurred but it was clear enough to recognize the errors. Most of them were obvious and could have been detected with any static code analysis tool (like CodeNARC) but in other examples the static analysis is not enough and someone needs to read the code and think about what is written. That\u0026rsquo;s why the main recommendation that Iván gave for this kind of errors is the proper usage of Code Reviews with other peers.\nGroovy GString magic, by Jacob Aae Mikkelsen (@JacobAae)\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if Jacob\u0026rsquo;s talk was going to be too basic, but knowing the speaker from other conferences I was confident that I could learn something. I was right in both assumptions, the talk was a complete review of the GString class in Groovy covering all the basic usages and the differences with the Java String class, the template engines, and the main caveats but the speaker also gave several interesting tips and tricks, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t knew all of them. It was specially nice the stripIndent method.\n@JacobAae talking about GString magic at #greach18 pic.twitter.com/szUy3MuTYM\n\u0026mdash; jmiguel (@jmiguel) March 16, 2018  From Functions to Monadic Style, by Dierk König (@mittie)\nDierk\u0026rsquo;s talk was mainly a live coding session. He performed an interesting exercise, typical in functional programming workshops, but with the twist of adding specific rules to the exercise in an incremental way as in a coding kata. The talk was very interesting and sometimes amusing starting with an hilarious statement: \u0026ldquo;As soon as you have understood monads, you immediately lose the ability to explain it!\u0026rdquo;.\n. @mittie admitted that he\u0026#39;s a Groovy-holic#greach18 pic.twitter.com/XRD1axwZRa\n\u0026mdash; Greach (@greachconf) March 16, 2018  Mapping a tree with Grails, by Sergio del Amo (@sdelamo)\nSergio gave a complete talk reviewing the tree data structure, commenting some use cases in which to use it and also comparing several different implementations of a data structure in Groovy: Adjacency lists, path enumeration, nested sets and closure tables. He remarked that the right design and implementation depends on the use case, if you normally need to query the leafs or an entire subtree, if the tree is mostly static or its subject to lots of insertions, etc.\n Sergio del Amo at Greach 2018   Reactive All The Way Down with Ratpack, Groovy, RxJava, React, and RabbitMQ, by Steve Pember (@svpember)\nThis talk was also very complete, describing the advantages of a reactive environment, the anatomy of a reactive service and how to make the main technology choices to build a proper Reactive application. Among all the advantages described by Steve I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight the optimized usage of resources, the reduction of synchronous communications and the increase of error protection due to have more decoupled and independent systems.\nAnother hilarious moment for me came when Steve described as a reason to keep using RabbitMQ that \u0026ldquo;you don\u0026rsquo;t mind being looked down upon by Kafka fans\u0026rdquo;. Not related to this, but in my company we are precisely replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka everywhere.\n. @svpember will talk about reactive systems \u0026#39;Reactive All The Way Down with Ratpack, RxGroovy, React, and RabbitMQ\u0026#39; #greach18 pic.twitter.com/HOXzEkFyi3\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) March 16, 2018  Launching the Micro Future: Groovy, Grails and MicroNaut, by Graeme Rocher (@graemerocher)\nIván López warned us about this talk and it was much more that what I expected. Graeme Rocher made the worldwide presentation of MicroNaut, an ultra-light cloud native reactive framework for the JVM. It\u0026rsquo;ll be compatible with Groovy and Java, but also with other languages of the JVM like Kotlin. The first milestones will be released by Q2 2018 and the GA version is expected by the end of the year.\nHello #greach18 conf attendees! It\u0026#39;s here! It\u0026#39;s here! It\u0026#39;s finally here! https://t.co/lt3Bglsb90 pic.twitter.com/iGbUZMn0gO\n\u0026mdash; The Micronaut Framework (@micronautfw) March 16, 2018  Graeme and the rest of the OCI people have been working on this since at least 1.5 years ago. They released Grails ten years ago, so they have all our confidence and respect. The premise is that Grails, and Spring of course, were not designed for a microservices world. They come from an era without most of the things that are common nowadays: microservices, without containers,\u0026hellip;\nSome quick hints about MicroNaut:\n It is designed from scratch with Microservices in mind It\u0026rsquo;s ultra-light weight (Grame shared some amazing numbers) and reactive (it\u0026rsquo;s based on Netty)  Can be run with as little as 10Mb Max Heap for Java (24MB for Groovy) Start-up time is below a second for Java (1 second for Groovy)   Compatible with any Reactive Streams implementation: RxJava 2.x, Reactor 3.x, Akka,\u0026hellip; Integrates AOP and compile time dependency injection (and this implies a lot, great topic to talk about), so no reflection and no runtime proxies It\u0026rsquo;s both HTTP client and server Service Discovery: Consul and Eureka are supported, Route 53 planned Client Side Load Balancing: Integrated with Netflix Ribbon Support for serverless computing via AWS Lambda Developed via the annotations from Java and the powerful AST transformations from Groovy.  Graeme also commented the roadmap of Grails (4.0 version in Q4 2018). We were all just too excited with MicroNaut but he confirmed that OCI will still evolve Grails (with MicroNaut integration), and that\u0026rsquo;s good news for everyone.\nGetting right to it, @graemerocher shows off some cool stuff that @micronautfw can do with a demo @greachconf! #micronautfw #grailsfw #groovylang #greach18 pic.twitter.com/laViV7iJ0s\n\u0026mdash; Object Computing (@ObjectComputing) March 16, 2018  Reactive Microservices with MicroNaut, by Álvaro Sánchez-Mariscal (@alvaro_sanchez)\nThis was my first talk of the Saturday at Greach. After the hype with MicroNaut in the previous day, the room was packed full to hear more details about the new framework from Álvaro. Álvaro made a detailed technical explanation about MicroNaut, comparing some of the decisions to the ones with Spring/Grails.\nHe also made a live demo testing some of the capabilities: service discovery, load balancing, reactive and fault tolerant. He showed a demo project that will be released with the framework: a pet store composed with several microservices built in different technologies (Java and Groovy) and each of them connected to a different backend (PostgreSQL, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4J, etc.).\n Álvaro Sánchez Mariscal at Greach 2018   GORM Reloaded – Data Services for the Win, by Graeme Rocher (@graemerocher)\nGraeme gave another very good talk, this time about GORM Data Services. He explained a lot of improvements, mainly related to joins and multi-tenancy. It was very interesting, now in my project we are analyzing the approach for a bunch of multi-tenant data bases and the talk gave me some ideas. He offered two distinct modes to tackle the multi-tenancy problems: data partitioning and isolating connections/sessions. GORM supports both approaches perfectly.\nI saw a lot of powerful features behind GORM Data Services, improving the performance and code maintenance, and simplifying amazingly the multi-tenant application development.\nGorm Data services with @graemerocher #greach18 pic.twitter.com/YixkBno3aq\n\u0026mdash; jmiguel (@jmiguel) March 17, 2018  101 scripts that can save you the day, by Jorge Aguilera (@jagedn) and Miguel Ángel Rueda (@MiguelRuGa)\nJorge and Miguel Ángel offered a funny theatrical performance to show the advantages of their project (101 Scripts) offering dozens of very useful scripts made in Groovy for a lot of common tasks. I had already reviewed the project page (baked with JBake, my previous static site generator) and some of the scripts and I loved it. I hope I\u0026rsquo;d be able to contribute in the future, at least with some translations.\nSurviving in a Microservices Environment, by Steve Pember (@svpember)\nMy last choice in Greach 2018 was to listen again to Steve Pember. This talk was focused on the technical and not technical choices and challenges in a microservices environment. Steve put the emphasis on three main topics (and I agree with him): infrastructure, architecture and team communication. He provided a valuable vision on this, with some useful insights. I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight one of them, related to team communication.\nHe reminded the audience Conway\u0026rsquo;s Law, with the assumption from his side (and I totally agree) that it\u0026rsquo;s completely real. If a company is not able to integrate all the required capabilities in its squads, it\u0026rsquo;ll be doomed to have knowledge silos and complex dependencies everywhere.\norganizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\n— M. Conway  Steve Pember at Greach 2018   And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Greach 2019!!\n",

    "title": "Travels With Charley: In Search of America, by John Steinbeck",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Travels with Charley: In Search of America is mainly what they call a travelogue o travel literature. It\u0026rsquo;s not the first time that I read one and I\u0026rsquo;m starting to enjoy the genre. I added this one to my want to read in Goodreads a long time ago after reading some hilarious paragraphs during a couple of English lessons, and the rest of the book had not disappointed me at all.\nJohn Steinbeck and Charley  In 1960, a 58 years old John Steinbeck bought a small camper to drive around the United States with his dog (Charley). He called the camper Rocinante (here you have a picture of it), the perfect name for a saddle in which to go on adventures. He said before the book was published:\nI was advised that the name Rocinante painted on the side of my truck in sixteenth-century Spanish script would cause curiosity and inquiry in some places. I do not know how many people recognized the name, but surely no one ever asked about it. The book was published in 1962 and Steinbeck died just six years later. Reading this book you can somehow perceive his age, obviously regarding his health condition but also because he didn\u0026rsquo;t care about others reading what he wrote or did. When he started the arrangements for the trip, everyone tried to persuade him to abandon the idea because it\u0026rsquo;s age and chronic disease, but he felt he needed the trip and that it was now or never.\nDuring the previous winter I had become rather seriously ill with one of those carefully named difficulties which are the whispers of approaching age. When I came out of it I received the usual lecture about slowing up, losing weight, limiting the cholesterol intake. It happens to many men, and I think doctors have memorized the litany. It had happened to so many of my friends. The lecture ends, “Slow down. You’re not as young as you once were.” And I had seen so many begin to pack their lives in cotton wool, smother their impulses, hood their passions, and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi-invalidism. In this they are encouraged by wives and relatives, and it’s such a sweet trap. Who doesn’t like to be a center for concern? A kind of second childhood falls on so many men. They trade their violence for the promise of a small increase of life span. In effect, the head of the house becomes the youngest child. And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror. For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping, worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness. I’ve lifted, pulled, chopped, climbed, made love with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment. I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage. My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby. The purpose of the trip was to get to know again his country and, in my opinion, as a way to say goodbye to several places, essential locations for him in the past. This quote summarizes his motivations:\nFor many years I have traveled in many parts of the world. In America I live in New York, or dip into Chicago, or San Francisco. But New York is no more America than Paris is France or London is England. Thus I discovered that I did not know my own country. I, an American writer, writing about America, was working from memory, and the memory is at best a faulty, warpy reservoir. I had not heard the speech of America, smelled the grass and trees and sewage, seen its hills and water, its color and quality of light. I knew the changes only from books and newspapers. But more than this, I had not felt the country for twenty-five years. In short, I was writing of something I did not know about, and it seems to me that in a so-called writer this is criminal. My memories were distorted by twenty-five intervening years. Steinbeck beautifully describes his feelings about the places or about the people he encountered, and that is what makes this book remarkable. He takes advantage of the trip circumstances to give his opinion on the social and political issues of 1960: decisive election year between Nixon and Kennedy, the embarrassing (even on those days for him) racial issues in the southern states and the cold war against the Soviet Union, just to give some examples.\nAs one can imagine reading the book, and it was confirmed some years after the publication, some of the dialogues during his encounters are purely fictional as a mean for the author to describe a situation or a way of thinking of the folks he encountered. Part of the magic resides in guessing which ones are more or less distant from his real experiences. He even describes the approach as a disclaimer:\nI've always admired those reporters who can descend on an area, talk to key people, ask key questions, take samplings of opinions, and then set down an orderly report very like a road map. I envy this technique and at the same time do not trust it as a mirror of reality. I feel that there are too many realities. What I set down here is true until someone else passes that way and rearranges the world in his own style. The book contains dozens of brilliant quotes, some of them with a beautiful and intense description that mentally transfers the reader to a certain American landscape:\nThe redwoods, once seen, leave a mark or create a vision that stays with you always. No one has ever successfully painted or photographed a redwood tree. The feeling they produce is not transferable. From them comes silence and awe. It's not only their unbelievable stature, nor the color which seems to shift and vary under your eyes, no, they are not like any trees we know, they are ambassadors from another time. They have the mystery of ferns that disappeared a million years ago into the coal of the carboniferous era. They carry their own light and shade. The vainest, most slap-happy and irreverent of men, in the presence of redwoods, goes under a spell of wonder and respect. You cannot use this book to prepare a similar trip, or to discover any of the places that he visited. He also wrote about it in the last part of the book, as a retrospective of what he finally ended writing, in one of my favorite quotes of the book:\nIf an Englishman or a Frenchman or an Italian should travel my route, see what I saw, hear what I heard, their stored pictures would be not only different from mine but equally different from one another. If other Americans reading this account should feel it true, that agreement would only mean that we are alike in our Americanness. From start to finish I found no strangers. If I had, I might be able to report them more objectively. But these are my people and this my country. If I found matters to criticize and to deplore, they were tendencies equally present in myself. If I were to prepare one immaculately inspected generality it would be this: For all of our enormous geographic range, for all of our sectionalism, for all of our interwoven breeds drawn from every part of the ethnic world, we are a nation, a new breed. Americans are much more American than they are Northerners, Southerners, Westerners, or Easterners. And descendants of English, Irish, Italian, Jewish, German, Polish are essentially American. This is not patriotic whoop-de-do; it is carefully observed fact. California Chinese, Boston Irish, Wisconsin German, yes, and Alabama Negroes, have more in common than they have apart. And this is the more remarkable because it has happened so quickly. It is a fact that Americans from all sections and of all racial extractions are more alike than the Welsh are like the English, the Lancashireman like the Cockney, or for that matter the Lowland Scot like the Highlander. It is astonishing that this has happened in less than two hundred years and most of it in the last fifty. The American identity is an exact and provable thing. I really liked this book, and for sure I\u0026rsquo;ll try to read more from Steinbeck.\n",

    "title": "FOSDEM 2018: Sunday",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "After an interesting Saturday, finished with a great dinner with some friends in one of our favorite restaurants in Brussels, my Sunday at FOSDEM started again very early.\nFOSDEM 2018  My choices for the Sunday were again diverse and (in most cases) successful. Apart from the closing keynotes, I spent some time in the Legal and Policy Issues devroom, a couple of talks in the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science devroom and half the afternoon in the Geospatial devroom.\nBefore continuing, if you want to read my summary of the previous day you can follow this link: FOSDEM 2018: Saturday. You will also find there general info and details about the event itself.\nLet me summarize:\nTalks Capture the GDPR with Identity management, by Juraj Benculak\nThis first talk was a bit disappointing. The intro about GDPR took most of the talk, and I bet that almost all of us who where there at 9am in a Sunday knew what GDPR is.\nThe recommendations for GDPR arrived very late. The speaker made a brief overview of how you can benefit from a nice data mapping and data governance, and how good it is to observe privacy by default and by design. Then, he introduced Identity Management as the ideal tool for the job demonstrating the lawfulness of all the data processing. The fact that he develops Identity Management software has something to do with it, of course.\nArtificial intelligence dealing with the right to be forgotten, by Cristina Rosu\nThe next talk in the Legal and Policy devroom was luckily more interesting, but again the title was misleading. Most of the talk was an intro to the right to be forgotten, including an overview of all the relevant legal cases starting with the Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González. Cristina Rosu complemented the legal intro with some metrics about GDPR compliance in some countries.\nSome statistics on deletion for GDPR compliance  In the last slides, the only part related to Artificial Intelligence, the speaker commented some possible approaches to enhance the right to be forgotten in the AI environment: Obfuscation strategies, data minimization, personal data stores, algorithmic transparency or ethical boards inside companies.\nBehind the scenes of a FOSS-powered HPC cluster, Ansible or Salt? Ansible AND Salt!, by Damien François\nThe speaker, as a systems engineer, is responsible of the automation of a medium-sized HPC infrastructure at the Louvain University. The purpose of his talk, quite interesting, was to advocate for the use of similar tools at the same time, instead of using the same tool for everything. Some features overlap, but he claimed that each tool can be more powerful in certain tasks, and separating tools also helps in defining responsibilities.\nThey use Cobbler to install and deploy Operating Systems and set-up hardware specific configuration, Ansible for one-off operations (setup RSA keys, register node to services or prepare config files) and Salt for daily management (configure system, install admin software or mount the user filesystem).\nHe ended comparing Ansible and Salt, reviewing the best characteristics of each of them as you can see in the picture that I took:\nWhat the speaker loves about Ansible and Salt  How DeepLearning can help to improve geospatial DataQuality, an OSM use case, by Olivier Courtin\nThe speaker started his talk reviewing some of the Quality Assurance tools available in the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, being the main ones: Keep Right, Osmose, OSM Inspector and Maproulette. The problem of them, and I know it very well because I\u0026rsquo;ve used them a lot, is that the detection can be automatic but only sometimes the tool is able to provide fix suggestions or a standard correction guide, and eventually all the corrections need to be done manually by a mapper (like me).\nThe premise of the talk was about using other datasets to highlight inconsistencies and, potentially, to predict some characteristics not present in the map using DeepLearning and satellite imagery. The results that he showed were impressive, but he also showed that a lot of work needs to be done in order to have enough quality to consider a more automated approach for Quality Assurance in OSM.\nCompleteness in OpenStreetMap starts by detecting inconsistencies as soon and as detailed as possible.\nApplying DeepLearning techniques to improve OpenStreetMap  Re-structuring a giant, ancient code-base for new platforms, by Michael Meeks\nAfter some interesting networking in the stands, I entered this talk with low expectations. I did not regret it because it was very interesting.\nThe talk was about the huge refactor that was needed in the codebase of LibreOffice to make it work in the Cloud. The speaker explained clearly why they needed to re-structure at all, the main problems that they faced (Windows and Linux rendering APIs) and how they solved critical issues like extreme coupling and threads management.\nThe summary of the talk in a quote is: \u0026ldquo;Fix each bug only once\u0026rdquo;. What a great statement.\nRe-structuring LibreOffice  Building Rock Climbing Maps with OpenStreetMap, by Viet Nguyen\nThis was my first talk in the Geospatial devroom, it was somehow inspiring despite I can\u0026rsquo;t say that I learned a lot. The speaker explained that, as a rock climbing lover, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find good data regarding climbing routes, walls and sectors so he started introducing that information himself in OpenStreetMap. He summarized his experience, the decisions that he had to take, and how he is trying to get more contributors for his project: OpenBeta.\nBuilding OSM based web app from scratch, by Nils Vierus\nI could imagine that this talk was going to be very basic and I guessed right, but I wanted to stay in the devroom for the next talks so I stayed in the room retaining my seat.\nThe speaker made a general overview about Programming languages to build an OSM based web app, IDEs, mapping libraries, OSM data retrieval tools, routing tools and even version control systems. Good introduction to the topic from a good speaker but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this kind of talks should have a place in FOSDEM.\nPrivacy aware city navigation with CityZen app, by Redon Skikuli\nThe speaker was nice and funny, but again the talk was not very advanced. It was more interesting when he talked about the Open Hackerspace that he collaborates with in Tirana (Albania) than the part related to the CitiZen App. The claim that the app is privacy aware is very limited. They just don\u0026rsquo;t keep your navigation data but in the end whenever they ask for the location of the user, an Android device stores the location anyway (directly or when requesting the nearest POIs).\nAs a nice addition, CitiZen allows the users to modify or insert the POIs retrieved from OSM by editing them inside the app.\nEvery subway network in the world, by Ilya Zverev\nThis talk was refreshing and reconciled me with the geospatial devroom. Ilya (software engineer at Maps.me) explained how he ended building the offline subway navigation feature for Maps.me. As he explained, when they started reviewing the available data in OpenStreetMap related to subways they realized that the information was very poor and incomplete. For example there was no way to map properly the connections between lines.\nHe started building a validator and then station by station, city by city, he improved the subway information in OSM. He even presented a proposal for the subway geospatial information, including new relations for the transfers.\nSubway stations schema in OpenStreetMap, according to Ilya Zverev  The story of UPSat, Building the first open source software and hardware satellite, by Pierros Papadeas\nOne of the most inspiring talks of the entire FOSDEM with a packed full Janson Room (with capacity for 1415 people).\nThe speaker explained how during 2016, the Libre Space Foundation a non-profit organization developing open source technologies for space, designed, built and delivered UPSat, the first open source software and hardware satellite.\nPierros Papadeas explaining the UPSat design and building process  He explained with some detail how he got involved, the current status of the project, the design, construction, verification, testing and delivery processes, etc. You should consider watching the video :-)\nExploiting modern microarchitectures, Meltdown, Spectre, and other hardware attacks, by Jon Masters\nThe closing keynote was given by Jon Masters (Computer Architect at Red Hat) about Meltdown and Spectre, as he was tech lead for mitigation efforts against them in Red Hat. Jon was surprisingly capable of explaining in less than 50 minutes what are those vulnerabilities about, how they were possible in the first place and what are the consequences of avoiding them. I already knew most of it but Jon made it even clearer for me, and surely for the rest of the audience given the applause he received.\nIt was specially amusing for me, as I\u0026rsquo;ve been refreshing my knowledge about the Tomasulo Algorithm these past months.\nMicrocode, Millicode and Chicken bits  And that\u0026rsquo;s all. See you in Brussels for FOSDEM 2019!!\n",

    "body": "After an uncertain landing a few hours ago (the airport in Madrid was barely working due to a snowy morning), I\u0026rsquo;ve just arrived home but instead of having some rest after an intense and though-provoking FOSDEM I felt the urge to start writing about my weekend in Brussels.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been there not only to enjoy this wonderful city with its trappist beers and great food, but specially to attend FOSDEM as I intend to do every year.\nFOSDEM 2018  For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know FOSDEM, it\u0026rsquo;s the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to Open Source development. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) ecosystem. It\u0026rsquo;s also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with faces (or with voices, like @lekum!) you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.\nI already wrote about it a couple of years ago, when I even gave a lightning talk in one FOSDEM Fringe event the Floss Community Metrics Meeting (FCM2).\n FOSDEM 2016: Friday FOSDEM 2016: Saturday FOSDEM 2016: Sunday  The numbers of this year speak for themselves:\n more than 8,000 attendees in only two days 652 speakers in 690 different events (talks or workshops, mainly) 57 tracks in 33 different rooms more than 350 hours of content, almost all of the events are available online with live streaming during the conference 56 stands of all kinds of projects: FSFE, Python Software Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, OSI, the Eclipse Foundation, O\u0026rsquo;Reilly, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Debian KDE, Gnome, LibreOffice, VLC, Jenkins, Perl, \u0026hellip;  To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is organized by volunteers, everything is community driven and it\u0026rsquo;s free to attend. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to register beforehand.\nFOSDEM 2018  As usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended:\nTalks Consensus as a Service, Twenty Years of OSI Stewardship, by Simon Phipps and Italo Vignoli\nThe Open Source label was born in February 3rd 1998, so we celebrated its 20th Anniversary during the opening day of FOSDEM 2018. Simon (President of the OSI) summarized the evolution of the Open Source environment in the last two decades, also guessing what are going to be the main challenges for the Free Open Source Software for it\u0026rsquo;s third decade.\nHe remarked that Open Source (OS) projects should not have a business model, the companies that uses those OS projects are the ones that need a realistic business model. I totally agree with this, OS projects can be relevant and positive for the society in a lot more ways than profitability of the founders. Open Source allows software users and developers to advance in their software freedom at work as well as in private.\nHe labeled the first decade (1998-2008) the decade of Advocacy \u0026amp; Controversy. We all still remember when in 2001 Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft said \u0026ldquo;Linux is a cancer\u0026rdquo; (although now apparently he loves it), or in 2005 when UNIX was made Open Source, or 2007 when Java was also made Open Source. In the beginning most OS was a proprietary replacement, but at the end of the decade everyone understood OS as a benefit.\nSimon labeled the second decade (2008-2018) the decade of Adoption and Ascendancy, with three main aspects: broad enterprise adoption, problems with software patents and GPL enforcement. Since 2008 most hidden infrastructure is based in OS, since 2011 OS enabled the web service business era, since 2013 the OS is powering the cloud/containers revolution, \u0026hellip; to the point that nowadays we can realize that Open Source is at the heart of most new software.\nSimon quoted Eben Moglen and his \u0026ldquo;Licenses are Constitutions for Communities\u0026rdquo;, and explained that \u0026ldquo;Open Source licenses are the multilateral consensus of the permissions and norms for a Community\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to respect the licenses, and that explains why for the community any violation of the license it\u0026rsquo;s felt like an awful aggression.\nDerived from the four essential freedoms of Free Software, Simon emphasized the real value of Open Source:\n Innovate without needing to ask first Start where others reached Stay in control of your own resources Share upkeep of your innovation Influence global ecosystems Be protected from others doing the same  Maybe my favorite talk this year. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect summaries as long as this one for other talks :-P\nCypher for Apache Spark (CAPS), by Martin Junghanns and Max Kießling\nAs part of Neo4J, the speakers explained why and how they created Cypher for Apache Spark (CAPS), to provide graph-powered data integration and graph analytical query workloads within the Apache Spark ecosystem. They presented the internal architecture, made a live demo with Spark and Apache Zeppelin and explained that CAPS is released as Open Source inside OpenCypher.\nThe Computer Science behind a modern distributed data store, by Michael Hackstein (@mchacki)\nThe first thing that Michael Hackstein (ArangoDB) explained was that he was replacing the original speaker (Max Neunhoeffer, that couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend for personal reasons), but in the end he gave a great talk about a complex topic, being clear and precise. Anyone could notice that the substitute speaker knew the subject perfectly.\nMichael explained the main challenges when building or using a modern distributed data store. He started with an important advice: \u0026ldquo;The first law of distributed data is\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t distribute data\u0026rdquo; :-) Having said that, he clarified that sometimes you cannot avoid it because you need to scale and/or you need to be resilient.\nIn a distributed system different parts need to agree on things (consensus) but it\u0026rsquo;s not always easy because the network has outages, drops, delays or duplicates packages, any disk fails or even an entire rack fails. He explained the basics of Consensus, as explained originally in the Paxos Consensus Protocol (1998) and later in Raft.\nAnother important thought was related to sorting. Most published algorithms are nowadays poorly efficient because the problem is no longer the comparison computations but the data movement between data stores. He explained Log Structure Merge Trees (LSM-trees) as a possible solution.\nHe also summarized other problems like the synchronization of machines (mitigated with Hybrid Logical Clocks) and Distributed ACID transactions, only supported as off today by Google Spanner (because they have the money to use atomic clocks) and Cockroach DB an Open Source clone of Spanner that achieved it without atomic clocks.\nLog structured merge trees (LSM-trees)  Digital Archaeology, Maintaining our digital heritage, by Steven Goodwin (@MarquisdeGeek)\nSteven Goodwin is the founder of the Digital Heritage, a (let me quote) \u0026ldquo;plan to collate the learnings and knowledge of computer systems from 1975 onwards so that students of technology and scholars of the future can understand how they work, how to use them, and how they affected the culture of the 20th century\u0026rdquo;.\nHe explained how in a few years time it will be difficult or even impossible to study retro-computers given the fact that its software is either proprietary, closed-source, written in an obsolete programming language or protected to prevent copying. Not only this, the hardware is also failing, the magnetic devices are no longer storing the information and so on.\nAfter raising awareness of the problem, he also gave several recommendations and methods necessary to preserve our legacy using emulations, mainly based in Open Source projects.\nJVM startup: why it matters to the new world order, by Daniel Heidinga\nIn the old world order the deployments were infrequent so the startup time was a very small fraction of the total up time. Now in the new world with CI/CD systems, microservice or serverless architectures controlling the startup time is essential. This topic is very hot right now.\nDaniel (OpenJ9 Project Lead) explained the problem and provided possible solutions inside the JVM, focusing mainly in the use of OpenJ9\u0026rsquo;s SharedClasses.\nOpenJ9 startup sequence  Class Metadata: A User Guide, by Andrew Dinn\nAndrew Dinn (Red Hat Open JDK) explained clearly what is the Class Metadata and why it matters inside the JVM. He also gave some real-life use cases to explain how design decisions can incur or avoid Class Metadata costs.\nJava's Metaspace Constant Pool Objects  Java in a World of Containers, by Mikael Vidstedt and Matthew Gilliard\nMikael (Director of the JVM group at Oracle) and Matthew (also from Oracle) explained that Oracle is focused on maintaining Java as the main language in the containers ecosystem thanks to, according to them, some of its characteristics:\n Managed language/runtime Hardware and operating system agnostic Safety and Security enforced by the JVM Reliable as compatibility is a key design goal Runtime adaptive Rich ecosystem  Also related to reducing the startup time and footprint needed, they also explained how (using the modular system of Java 9) creating custom JREs allows you to reduce the size of the JDK needed inside the Docker container. A full JDK weights around 568 MB, the java.base module just 46 MB and a reasonable set of modules with complete capabilities could be around 60 MB. It can be further optimized using jlink \u0026ndash;compress but it\u0026rsquo;s a trade-off between size and compressing/uncompressing effort.\nAfter reducing the JDK layer of a container, the next battle is in the operating system layer. They announced and presented OpenJDK Portola Project, a port of the JDK to use Alpine Linux (the base image weights just 4 MB) and the musl C library. Very impressive.\nOpenJDK Portola Project  Class Data Sharing, Sharing Economy in the HotSpot VM, by Volker Simonis\nVolker (SAP) introduced Class Data Sharing (CDS), explained clearly the implementation details and finally he demonstrated it\u0026rsquo;s advantages in some use cases.\nClass Representation in the HotSpot VM  Hairy Security, the many threats to a Java web app, by Romain Pelisse and Damien Plard\nRomain (Red Hat) and Damien (Solaris Bank) gave a fun and instructive talk about security, challenging some myths.\nThey reminded us that it’s not a question of \u0026lsquo;if\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;when\u0026rsquo; you’ll be hacked.\nIf you want to read my summary of the next day you can follow this link: FOSDEM 2018: Sunday.\n",

    "title": "Some things that Java developers really need to know in 2018",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "A couple of days ago DZone published an article called 9 Things Java Programmers Should Learn in 2018. I liked the idea and I even recommended the article to a couple of colleagues who are trying to reorient their professional career. After the advice I added some personal disclaimers about the content, to the point that one of my friends wisely told me:\n if you don't agree with these recommendations, why don't you write your own article?  \u0026hellip;and that brought us here :-)\nThe article in DZone is fine and very detailed with good recommendations but it\u0026rsquo;s not realistic. Some of the things that the author considers essential (Android development or Spring Security, for example) for me are not that important, at least from a general perspective. You can (and should) learn them if you need them, but 99% of you will survive without them.\nInstead of sharing my view only with a couple of colleagues, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to give a realistic and opinionated (yes, I like the word) list of things in no particular order that you need to know or learn in 2018 if you are a Java developer. Some of them are not new, but you need to be sure that you know (or master, if you want) them by the end of the year.\nI\u0026rsquo;m addressing only Java developers, but hopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll find something of value even if you\u0026rsquo;re not.\nLearn Java 8, and then Java 9 January 2018 and I still find a lot of Java developers who do not know much about Java 8. Regarding this, my recommendation clearly is to learn separately Java 8 with the huge amount of improvements it brought to the language and then, and only then, start playing with Java 9.\nYou will be a better developer after you learn Java 8, even if in your current project they force you to code in Java 6. You\u0026rsquo;ll understand why some improvements were needed in the language and you\u0026rsquo;ll be the first in the line when a migration to Java 8 or 9 approaches in your surroundings (and it will, eventually).\nBut let me remark this, it does not matter if you have dozens of badges in Codecademy or Code School if by the end of 2018 you are not familiar with Java 8 and Java 9.\nUnit Testing as the logical choice If at this point of your career you don\u0026rsquo;t write unit tests you can stop reading the article right now, this is not going with you. If on the contrary you are already used to write unit tests for your code, your next goal is to write better tests.\nAre you stuck with JUnit? JUnit 5 was released recently and I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked it yet, but let me recommend a more logical choice: Spock. Less verbose, more idiomatic, integrated stubbing and mocking, easy parametrized testing, test data tables, \u0026hellip; If you are using JUnit, there is nothing that prevents you from going to Spock (totally or at least partially to test the new features).\nBeside the framework, now that you are familiar with the classic code coverage metrics, take a look to Pitest and mutation testing principles in general.\nJVM internals Yes, performance tuning is important and learning about it will help you in your daily work, in yearly rise negotiations and job interviews in general. But let\u0026rsquo;s take a step back, do you really know the JVM internals enough before looking at it with a magnifying glass? I\u0026rsquo;ve met a huge amount of developers and Java Architects that don\u0026rsquo;t even know what GC is, what does Stop The World mean or how does a dynamic class loader work.\nYes, it\u0026rsquo;s great to know how to analyze and profile an application to figure out why it\u0026rsquo;s so slow or why it crashes. But unfortunately for you, you can not always blame others. Make your best effort to understand that not everything is magic.\nLearn Apache Groovy Once you know your weapons, it\u0026rsquo;s good that you know what you\u0026rsquo;re up against. Forget for the moment about Kotlin and Scala, focus first on consolidating your Java skills. As with Spock, there are few excuses to prevent you from coding in Apache Groovy, and the learning curve is totally flat.\nGroovy is not only Java without semicolons. The description in the project website is clear enough so let me quote it:\nApache Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming. OK, I said that you will likely survive without Android knowledge and for sure you\u0026rsquo;ll probably survive without learning Groovy. But even if you find it difficult to use it in your projects I firmly believe that learning Groovy will have a substantial impact on your career and will even make you a better Java developer.\nJoin me in the next Greach Conference and you won\u0026rsquo;t regret.\nCode regularly As the DZone article remarks, sadly it\u0026rsquo;s usual practice to spend less time coding as your experience grows. This would deserve a totally different article, but for the moment let me stress that whatever your work experience is, you should not disconnect from programming and source code in general.\nThere are a lot of online resources about problems to be solved or challenges in general, but you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to complicate yourself or challenge others. You can simply think about something you need at home (or at squad level) and try to create a software tool to mitigate or solve those problems. I personally would recommend both approaches: try to enjoy the technical and social part of the hackatons or coding challenges but also try to solve your needs in solitude at home.\nTry new data structures, learn new algorithms and understand the pros and cons of them. Force yourself to struggle solving a specific problem without using the most appropriate data structure or without loops, for example.\nLearn from others and let others learn from you As others say there are only two ways to improve yourself, learning from your own experience (which is very limited) or learning from others experience (which is unlimited).\nAsk for recommendations and read technical books, related to the Java ecosystem or not. Learn first about the principles: clean code, design patterns, testing, functional programming, \u0026hellip;\nRead more code. It can be code from an open source project or code from your squad\u0026rsquo;s fellows. Try to find both the good patterns and the bad smells. Discuss with your peers about it (always politely) and let them also learn from you.\nWrite about your experiences, in a blog preferably. The writing exercise itself will help you consolidate what you are learning. Use an open source static site generator and you\u0026rsquo;ll also learn designing your site and deploying your blog posts.\nGet involved with your community. Try to attend local Meetups and technical conferences, eventually you\u0026rsquo;ll find the courage to even send proposals for those meetups and conferences.\nLuis, I already know everything! OK, it\u0026rsquo;s not my case but if you already know everything that I mentioned (or so you think) let me give some bonus recommendations:\n  If you are a proficient Java developer, you should consider staying in the back-end. It may seem that it is unavoidable to code front-end, but there is plenty of fun and complexity in the back. Nowadays you can evolve and grow your career without changing the platform.\n  Learn about performance and fine tuning, at least the basics.\n  Learn about Apache Kafka, it\u0026rsquo;ll open you some doors now and probably lots more in the near future.\n  Improve your knowledge and skills about DevOps culture and Cloud Computing.\n  Do not settle for anything. If your job/company does not give you what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, you must run out of there.\n  Feedback Remember, this opinionated recommendations are focused on Java developers about what they could do in 2018. It does not necessarily apply to other professionals.\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something?\nLet me know in the comments!\n",

Este año haré un nuevo intento de arrancar algo estable, veremos si tengo éxito.

    "title": "Brittany: a brief opinionated guide",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "As explained in the previous post, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently been in Normandy and Brittany with my friend Agatha. After publishing the first part of the trip (Normandy: a brief opinionated guide) now I proceed to do the same with Brittany.\nIt has been quite complicated because we saw a lot of awesome things and for me it still takes a lot of time (several hours) to write this kind of articles.\nWhat to expect from this guide I don\u0026rsquo;t like to repeat myself, so I invite you to read the disclaimers in the Normandy article. I\u0026rsquo;ll simply put here the map of Brittany prepared by Agatha.\n Map with the main places to visit in Brittany, prepared by Agatha   Let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nDol-de-Bretagne Our first stop in Brittany from Normandy was precisely in a town that was besieged several times by the Normands. In 1924 the town changed its name from Dol to Dol-de-Bretagne, maybe to discourage a new attempt by their neighbours.\nDol-de-Bretagne deserves a quick visit, not only to see its Cathedral and the quaint Grand Rue des Stuarts (Dol is considered the origin of the famous royal House of Stewart) but specially to see a huge menhir (the estimated weight is 125-150 tons).\n Dol-de-Bretagne menhir   Cancale We arrived Cancale at the right time, just before lunch. This fishing village is famous for its oyster beds, its oyster farmers everywhere, its popular oyster market, and its countless restaurants where you can order oysters. According to Wikipedia, the oyster beds of Cancale cover more than 7 square kilometers, and they harvest about 25,000 tons of oysters each year. Impressive, even for someone like me who finds eating raw oysters quite disgusting.\n Panoramic with lots of oysters beds and the popular Oyster Market   Cancale\u0026rsquo;s Oyster Market is famous because in the stalls they sell freshly caught oysters on a plate or tray with a slice of lemon, and people eat them right there by the sea. The initial plan was to visit the market before lunch so that Agatha could satisfy her appetite. After seeing one after another the handful of stalls that were there open, the rumors say that Agatha did not find the idea very pleasant and had to settle for trying the oysters in the restaurant.\nThere were countless restaurants, I suspect that in high season it will be difficult to come and eat in a decent place without reservation.\nBonus recommendation: Restaurant Le Cancalais, one of the finest restaurants in Cancale, although perhaps also one of the most expensive. Great menu with several seafood and fish dishes.\nSaint-Malo Saint-Malo was one of the main positive surprises of the trip. With an historic center that is itself a walled citadel, Saint-Malo was in the past notorious for its privateering and pirate activities. Today, it is considered the most visited place in Brittany.\nAlthough the day was windy it was not very cold, and with a vin chaud in the hand we took a very cool walk over the city walls. I thought initially that it was the standard insipid posh town with glamorous sites everywhere but I found a charming town with (yes) lots of glamorous places everywhere. Maybe I put a lot of my part, but I perfectly imagined the streets and beaches full of corsairs.\n Panoramic on top of the Jardin des Petit Murs, Saint-Malo   Bonus recommendation: Café La Java, by pure chance we stopped for a coffee in this spectacular place. The decoration was based on dolls, puppets and lots of circus material. The chairs on the bar were swing chairs hanging from the ceiling\u0026hellip; everything was incredible, even the blow they gave us when we asked for the bill.\nDinard After the positive surprise of Saint-Malo we decided to visit Dinard, another famous tourist destination for wealthy people in this case mainly from the United Kingdom. We took a short walk after the sunset that did not allow us to see much but we ended with the feeling that the place looks nice for the spring and summer but it\u0026rsquo;s basically dead in the low season.\nThe most remarkable moment, and it was not prepared in advance, was the photo that I took next to an statue of Alfred Hitchcock with an Alfred Hitchcock\u0026rsquo;s t-shirt. Hitchcock visited several times the town for holidays, to the point that the locals even claim that the house used in Psycho is based on a still standing villa of Dinard. The statue is full size a replica (or vice versa) of the trophies for the winners of the Dinard British Film Festival, held here every year since 1989.\n In Dinard, with Sir Alfred Hitchcock   Dinan Dinan was also one of those villages that could deserve a relaxed weekend getaway. We quietly walked through its center despite the rain, crossing countless streets and squares with picturesque facades and shops. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t climb La Tour de l\u0026rsquo;Horloge to see the views from up there, but maybe you should.\nI think that Dinan was the first town where we enjoyed a town center more or less protected from the cars and the traffic. This helped a lot to improve our sense of comfort there. As happened in Saint-Malo, the town center was full of nice shops and restaurants, giving the pedestrian the feeling of being inside a spectacular outdoor mall.\n Panoramic in Dinan   Côte de Granit Rose The Côte de Granit Rose (Pink Granite Coast) is a \u0026gt;30km stretch of coastline famous due to its unusual pink sands and rock formations. This is an unique place, and several curious and picturesque areas can be seen from different places. Beside the coast and the cliffs, most of the house and chalets in the area were also built with this pink granite.\nWe went first to some viewpoints inside Perros-Guirec and then to Ploumanac\u0026rsquo;h, close to the main area for visitors to the Pink Granite Coast in the Pors Karmor bay. It is supposed to be more startling during the summer because there is more sunlight, but it\u0026rsquo;s a recommended visit at any time of the year.\n Panoramic in the Côte de Granit Rose   Bonus recommendation: Restaurant Le Ker Louis, again we ended there a little bit by chance, because we tried before in several places that turned out to be closed, and it was a tremendous luck. Our lunch was spectacular, very well prepared and quite inexpensive.\nRumengol and Le Faou We planned Le Faou and Rumengol (a small village that belongs to Le Faou as well) as two quick visits in our way from the northern coast of Brittany to the Pointe du Raz, and we were not mistaken.\nRumengol has a curious church (Notre-Dame-du-Tout-Remède) that hosts a significant pilgrimage ceremony, one of the main ones in Brittany. We only saw the church from the outside and after the sunset, but it looked very special and quite different from others. Le Faou has a couple of cute streets, nice but nothing remarkable where almost all the villages have the same.\nPointe du Raz Pointe du Raz is one of the sites that most impressed me on the trip and one of the places that I will remember the most. It is a rocky promontory that is just embedded into the sea, but the sensation there with strong waves crushing the cliffs and hurricane winds was really special. Totally overwhelming, to the point that it seemed dangerous to go near the edge of the cliffs in case the wind blew you away. I\u0026rsquo;m not surprised that the French considered it the end of the world.\nFrom the headland, you can see several lighthouses of different sizes located on rocks or small islands. It\u0026rsquo;s the place that I know where more lighthouses can be seen.\n Notre Dame des Naufrages looking into the sea   Locronan We really wanted to see Locronan and we were not disappointed. Narrow streets, cute shops, houses made of stone and slate,\u0026hellip; Our only problem was that we arrived exactly when dozens of workers and gardeners were conditioning and decorating the entire town in a big way for XMas. It was full of vans, tractors, boxes, sacks,\u0026hellip; but despite all this, the town looked beautiful.\nLocronan is a deserved member of the Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (The most beautiful villages of France) association. Le Faou is also a member but there are huge differences in terms of beauty and care.\n Panoramic of the Place de l\u0026#39;Église in Locronan   Bonus recommendation: Ty Kouign Amann, one of the finest chocolate shops we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the trip. It was so tempting that we left there with a bag full of chocolates.\nQuimper Among all the large towns (or small cities) that we visited, Quimper was one of the ones I liked the most. Several gardens, beautiful houses and the usual town center full of nice shops, boutiques and restaurants. Also, the Cathedral has a feature that makes it special. The main nave is bended in the middle, so much that it is clearly perceived both inside and outside the temple.\nBonus recommendation: Le Sistrot, this marvelous place is both cider house and refined restaurant, they served us one of the best meals of the entire trip. They had in the menu dozens of different ciders from all over the world and of many different types, for example I ordered one made of 5 different kinds of apples. I was left wanting to order the add-on for the menu that included a different cider to match with each plate, dessert included.\nVille Close The Ville Close (Walled Village) is a fortified island forming a medieval small village inside the town of Concarneau. It was nice but somehow disappointing because it\u0026rsquo;s very very small and 90% of the shops and restaurants inside the fortress were closed. It is sized for many people, and they even had an outdoor theater, so surely in other seasons it will be much more attractive.\n Panoramic of the Ville Close and the Marina of Concarneau   Pont-Aven Pont-Aven is mainly known for the Pont-Aven School of Arts, a group of artists in the 19th century led by Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin that painted every corner of this town. Now Pont-Aven is full of tourists, restaurants and art galleries.\nTo reinforce the impressionist atmosphere that inspired (and inspires) the painters and charms the visitors, the entire village specially around the river was illuminated in a very special way. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is always like this or only on these pre-XMas dates.\n Panoramic of the River Aven passing through Pont-Aven, with nice colours and lights   Auray We made a quick visit to Auray, just to walk a while through the center and to have dinner. It\u0026rsquo;s nice, not as interesting as other places in Brittany but I\u0026rsquo;d recommend a visit if you pass near there.\nCarnac Carnac is renowned for the Carnac stones, one of the most extensive Neolithic menhir collections in the world. Within the limits of the town you can visit several areas with kilometers of alignments of stones of different sizes, some of them over two meters high. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what is more impressive, the fact that they could do that around 4500 BC or that most of them in this area are still standing in the 21st century.\nNear a couple of alignments you can also find a huge menhir, brilliantly called Le Géant du Manio, with more than 6m of height. Le Géant is hidden inside a forest, so you need to walk for 10-15\u0026rsquo; to reach there but the short walk is worth it because the forest is impressive. I would love to have forests like that near my house.\n Inside one of the stone alignments in Carnac   Vannes Vannes was also a positive surprise. It\u0026rsquo;s quite big (more than 50K inhabitants), but the town center is again very well preserved and luckily for them restricted to vehicles. Narrow streets with nice shops and restaurants everywhere.\nOne of the differential elements of Vannes is his port, built in an elongated way to take the sea into the center of the city.\n Panoramic of the Port-de-Vannes, with the famous Place Gambetta in the left   Bonus recommendation: Restaurant Rive Gauche, possibly the restaurant that we liked the most. The plates were spectacular, refined and inexpensive. It\u0026rsquo;s very small, so you should book in advance.\nMalestroit We only had time for a quick walk through the center of Malestroit and it was raining a lot, so we couldn\u0026rsquo;t see this small village as calmly as we normally do but what we saw was very beautiful. They were celebrating a charity market, and we were able to buy them vin chaud so our memory of them will always be positively biased.\nLa Gacilly La Gacilly is famous for two things: it\u0026rsquo;s local craftsmen stores (not as valuable as they were described) and Yves Rocher. This cosmetic company was founded here, and everywhere you look you\u0026rsquo;ll see something related to it: shops, restaurants, cafés, spas, hotels,\u0026hellip; the company even maintains a botanical garden in La Gacilly, open to the public without charge.\nRochefort-en-Terre Rochefort-en-Terre was perhaps the most anticipated destination by Agatha. During the entire year is just another nice village with stone houses, attractive restaurants, galleries, cute shops\u0026hellip; but during the last days of the year it changes entirely to transform the entire village into a magnificent XMas market. It\u0026rsquo;s true that after the sunset the environment is magical with all those lights and even some artificial snow flakes in some streets. The magic disappears partially because it was infested with visitors, even more than Mont Saint-Michel.\nThat night we slept in another small town close to Rochefort-en-Terre so in addition to seeing it at night, the next day we walked by there with sunlight and it was also interesting, specially because we were almost alone. The bad thing is that everything was closed that early in the morning.\n Rochefort-en-Terre at night   Josselin Josselin is considered one of the most beautiful medieval villages in Brittany. In addition to having the typical facades with wooden beams, here I had the impression that they were painted with more care and style. We took a good walk but we could not enter the castle, things that happen when the monuments are privately owned.\n Josselin\u0026#39;s colourful facades   Brocéliande Forest We really wanted to spend a few hours hiking through the forest of Brocéliande (a legendary forest commonly considered to be the Paimpont forest in Brittany) but two things crossed our path once we started the route: a copious rain and a sign forbidding us to continue. The forest, at least the part that tourists cross, is privately owned and that makes it possible that the main forest area only opens from April 1st to September 30th.\nAnyway, our limited walk was great specially under the rain.\n Inside Brocéliande forest   Bonus recommendation: Crêperie La Fée Gourmande, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to eat in Paimpont because everything was closed, but in the end someone told us how to get to a creperie in the outskirts that would surely be open. La Fée Gourmande is not in the center of the town but it\u0026rsquo;s amazingly located in the shore of the Étang de l\u0026rsquo;Abbaye de Paimpont and the galettes were amazing. a total success because they were also very nice with us.\nFougères We were on the verge of not being able to go to Fougères due to the lack of time and I\u0026rsquo;m very glad that we could finally make it, even if it was at the cost of having cut the walk through Brocéliande.\nThe Château, a huge stronghold built atop a granite ledge, is one of the most famous attractions in the area. It\u0026rsquo;s very well preserved and the visit with the audioguide explains clearly the history of the castle and the city in the Middle Ages.\nAs in many other places, we were almost alone so we could make funny things like climbing two different towers so we could take each other a picture on top of the other tower. I have several epic pictures in this castle, it\u0026rsquo;s a pity that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have my bow and some arrows to pose properly.\n Panoramic inside Fougères Castle   The town itself is nice, specially because it\u0026rsquo;s located on top of a hill and the views are magnificient both from the village to the castle and from the castle to the village. The garden surrounding the Cathedral was full of lights and XMas figures (and people).\nRennes Our visit to Rennes was slightly disappointing, we planned one evening and a morning there but we could only see the Cathedral. We tried hard to visit the Parlament de Bretagne but they exhausted us by making us cross the center of the city to go to a tourist office that later turned out to be closed\u0026hellip; Rennes is very big (10th largest city in France) and it seemed to be a very lively city but they did not prove to be very well prepared for tourists out of season.\nI would not mind coming back and spending a quiet weekend here.\n Typical pedestrian street in Rennes, the house on the left is unique because the wood is painted in 3 different colors   Vitré Vitré was our last stop in the trip through Normandy and it was not a bad culmination. We were able to take a pleasant walk under a light rain, and after lunch we visited the castle. The part of the castle that you can visit is small but interesting, the other part holds the Town Hall and other official dependencies.\n The entrance to Vitre Castle   Bonus recommendation: Restaurant Le Petit Bouchon, it\u0026rsquo;s outside the historic center, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible for you to end up eating here if it\u0026rsquo;s not after a recommendation. We ate very well and were treated perfectly. Their Café Gourmand is delicious.\nLe Mans Le Mans is not in Brittany, but it was on our way to Charles de Gaulle to return the car and flight back home. They claim to be the second most known French city around the world, and this is because since 1923 the city hosts the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance car race.\nWe couldn\u0026rsquo;t enter the Cathedral but we liked a lot the rest of the town center. It\u0026rsquo;s nice and very lively. They have a cute area around the monument to the 24H of Le Mans race, which is indistinguishable from a shopping mall due to the amount of shops of all kinds.\nThe Museum of the 24 Hours of Le Mans is full of real sport cars and bikes with a few replicas, very interesting to any aficionado of the races. The vehicles were grouped by category and year, so it was easy and educational to follow the evolution of the technological improvements. One of the most curious things were some showcases with miniatures of all the cars that participated every year.\n The last items in the collection of the Museum of the 24 Hours of Le Mans   In addition to the museum, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do a walking tour through the Circuit de la Sarthe. The visit includes access to the stands, bleachers and the pelouse area. I enjoyed it but it would have been nice to be able to visit other interesting areas like the boxes, the workshops, the VIP areas\u0026hellip; or even lending us a car to make a whole lap to the circuit :-)\n Circuit de la Sarthe, the main part of the 24 Hours of Le Mans Circuit   I hope that you enjoyed the guide!\n",

    "body": "Some months ago I wrote in the blog about my road trip through the Romantikstraße in Austria. I shared the trip with Agatha and it went great, so we took advantage of the fact that we both had several pending holidays for this year and repeated the experience in two of the most beautiful regions in France: Normandy and Brittany. This post will be a summary of our experience in Normandy and hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to write a similar one for Brittany.\nWhat to expect from this guide The trip was decided and confirmed like four or five days before leaving so we couldn\u0026rsquo;t prepare a lot but at least Agatha was able to prepare a list of places to visit in both regions. Specially for Brittany she even made the effort to collect several articles with comments and recommendations of places. Being honest, we could not follow most of them (they were written for other times of the year and other kind of travelers) but it was very helpful anyway.\nSo, our trip started with many places to visit, a few notes and very few hours of daylight to see things. We had to be very practical and extremely flexible, but in the end almost all the decisions went well so I decided to relate the trip from an opinionated point of view, as I have been asked by several colleagues and friends.\n Map with the main places to visit in Normandy, prepared by Agatha   For each place, I\u0026rsquo;ll summarize our experience there with the list of places we visited and some comments on them. There is much more to visit, It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the essentials of each city or town.\nI will not include purely practical info like ticket prices and opening times, it changes a lot and sooner than later it becomes obsolete info. Alas, we were forced to visit some places only during the evening/night with all the museums and attractions closed.\nThe entire trip was made by car and we booked all our stays in the same day. Normally around 5-6pm and some days even later, the advantages of traveling in the low season.\nI\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll forget a lot of things, maybe in the next trip I\u0026rsquo;ll choose to be copilot so I can take notes during the trip.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start!\nRouen After landing in Charles de Gaulle around 3pm, we picked the rental car and our first destination was Rouen, capital city of Normandy. The city is known for its gorgeous downtown, its famous gothic Cathedral and for being the place where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.\nWe arrived later than expected so everything was closed. The Cathedral was supposed to be open (according to the web) but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. Luckily in front of the cathedral there was a Christmas Market so we had our first vin chaud to warm ourselves for a walk the town center.\nPlaces we visited:\n Notre Dame Cathedral, it\u0026rsquo;s huge and awesome, specially from the outside. One of the finest gothic cathedrals around Europe.   Notre Dame Cathedral, Rouen    Gros Horloge, a fourteenth-century two-sides astronomical clock, not as spectacular as the one in Prague, for example, but you should not miss it as it\u0026rsquo;s close to the Cathedral. Place du Vieux Marché and the Church of St Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc was burned alive for heresy in this square in 1431, there is a small memorial with a huge cross marking the spot. The church was completed in 1979, quite modern but the place it\u0026rsquo;s very interesting. The stained glass windows are from the 16th century, retrieved from other church, and the building itself is worth the visit. It\u0026rsquo;s very long, crossing almost entirely the square, and evokes both flames and an overturned ship. There is also an interesting gourmet market beside the church, following the same design.   Place du Vieux Marché, Rouen    Church of Saint Ouen, the largest gothic temple of Rouen that started as an abbey church but was vacated and it serves now other purposes as part of the Town Hall. When we entered, there was an organ concert and a moder art exposition. Church of St Maclou, this 15th century gothic temple is much smaller than the other touristic temples but in my opinion it\u0026rsquo;s the most quaint one. Also, the best streets to find a good place to eat or drink (as a resident told us) are the ones surrounding St Maclou. Aître Saint-Maclou, It is one of the rarest ossuaries remaining in Europe. It\u0026rsquo;s origin as a normal cemetery dates back to the Black Death. After a new epidemic in the 16th century it became necessary to increase its capacity so they build galleries with several rooms to contain the bones. Other interesting places we couldn\u0026rsquo;t visit properly: the Musée des Beaux-Arts, the Musée Le Secq des Tournelles and the Tower of Jean of Arc.  Bonus recommendation: Restaurant L\u0026rsquo;Anticonformiste, the food was great and they have an interesting atmosphere and decoration. It was full of locals, but the place is tourist friendly.\nThe Normandy Abbeys Trail This interesting trail starts with the Church of Saint-Ouen in Rouen, and continues near the city following down the course of the Seine River.\n Saint-Georges Abbey in Saint-Martin-de-Boscherville, sadly it was closed so we couldn\u0026rsquo;t enter (not even the gardens) but there is a remarkable bakery that compensated us. Jumièges Abbey, it was a Benedictine monastery, now turned into a nice ruins. The remains are perfectly preserved and the audioguide tells a lot, but maybe I missed more context information about the place. We had the entire place almost empty for ourselves, I feel that the visit will lose a lot if crowded with people.   Jumièges Abbey    Saint-Wandrille Abbey, we arrived late for the guided visit (in French) so we had to settle for being able to take a walk around. The place is still hosting a community of monks, so you cannot see a lot without a proper tour. Nice but you can skip it if you are not going to enter and visit the place properly.  Étretat Étretat is known for its cliffs, including three natural arches and a pointed formation called L\u0026rsquo;Aiguille (the Needle) which rises 70 metres above the sea. We lunched there the typical mussels before walking through the beach to get to a cave by which you can cross to another rock beach to see the largest arch and the Needle, not visible from the town. As many other things around here, with high tide you cannot reach the tunnel so we were more or less lucky. There is also an interesting trail through the cliffs, so we hiked for a while and enjoyed a couple of viewpoints.\nBonus recommendation: La Salamandre, the typical restaurant to eat Mules e Frites (mussels with french fries), the waiters were friendly and both the building and the decoration are unique.\n Étretat beach and cliffs panoramic   Honfleur Sadly we had to choose between Le Havre and Honfleur (the northern and southern banks of the estuary of the Seine River, respectively) and we opted for the latter to continue exploring the good rural taste of Normandy. Probably we made a good choice because we loved Honfleur, a lot, and we only regret not having been able to walk it during day.\nHonfleur is full of restaurants, boutiques, chocolate shops, art workshops and galleries. Almost everything was open until late so I can imagine that they are used to receive a big bunch of tourists. Lucky us, we visited everything almost empty and we could had dinner in a great restaurant without a previous booking.\n Saint-Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Church, this temple was built almost entirely with wood and incredibly it is still standing. It is the largest church made out of wood in France. To add more value to the place, it\u0026rsquo;s said that it was built without using any saw, only cutting the wood with axes. It\u0026rsquo;s very beautiful both inside and outside. Vieux Basin and Le Lieutance, close to the church you can find the picturesque old port, one of the finest that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the entire trip, and the old house of the Lieutenant.   Le Vieux Basin, Honfleur    Le Jardin du Tripot, one of those marvelous places that only locals, very well informed tourists and geocachers get to visit. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss it, I won\u0026rsquo;t tell more to avoid spoiling the surprise.  Bonus recommendation: L\u0026rsquo;Homme de Bois, Honfleur is full of restaurants for all pockets but this one convinced us just by crossing ahead. We could not have dinner better, I tried their grilled stingray fin and it was delicious.\nNormandie Battle coast, museums and memorials We visited several landmarks related with Second World War, the Battle of Normandy and the Normandy landings. We didn\u0026rsquo;t enter all the museums as they are apparently very similar, but we probably visited the most relevant ones.\n Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie, one of the biggest collection of vehicles and weapons (mainly originals with some replicas). The way they present the collection may have aged too much, they would improve a lot if they changed the appearance of some posters and displays, and the approach of the signage in some areas.   Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie    German Cemetery, our first truly sad place of the trip. Many years have passed but it continues to impress me the amount of people involved in WWII. The cemetery was totally empty for us, and it was specially impressive thanks to a chilly atmosphere with some fog and the early sun.   German Cemetery    Le Pointe du Hoc, one of the most representative places of the Normandy landings, as it still concentrates most of the remaining bunkers, and dozens of huge craters caused by the bombings. Again, visiting the place almost alone was specially valuable as you could enjoy the silence and try to imagine the place during those terrible days. The storming of the place by a couple hundred American rangers is one of the most epic episodes of the entire Battle of Normandy.   Le Pointe du Hoc    Omaha Beach, maybe the most famous landmark and the one with less present day remains. The beach is huge, no wonder it was a key point in the landings being also the most heavily defended beach.   Omaha Beach    American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville-sur-Mer. Another iconic visit, with its countless tombs overlooking the sea. The contrast with the German cemetery was huge, in many aspects. Curiously, a couple of big murals in the memorial helped me understand much better some concepts and tactical explanations that I\u0026rsquo;ve read the day before in the Normandy Battle Memorial Museum.   American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville-sur-Mer    The German Batteries at\tLongues-sur-Mer, another typical visit with several German batteries preserved almost perfectly with only the damages caused by the war conflict itself. Walking by the closest ones to the coast, it\u0026rsquo;s enough to turn yourself to feel still threatened by the batteries that are still standing.   German Batteries at Longues-sur-Mer    Port Winston or Mulberry harbours. Most of the temporary portable harbour in front of Arromanches is still there, exactly where they were voluntarily sunk. They were developed by the British and meant to be used until the allies captured a normal French port. Another example of the logistical effort that both sides reached during the conflict. What a pity of wasted resources and talent.   Port Winston or Mulberry harbours    Mémorial de Caen, the biggest museum related to WWII in Normandy. The visit is supposed to be essential, but for us it was more and more of the same content. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend to visit it before going to the rest of the Normandy landing areas. Again, we could enjoy it a lot being almost alone in the entire museum, including a 25-30\u0026rsquo; projection of a film in a 200-250 seat cinema for us alone.   Mémorial de Caen   Bayeux Bayeux itself is nice and deserves a visit, but it\u0026rsquo;s specially advisable because it is the home of the Bayeux Embroidery. It has always been called the Bayeux Tapestry although it is not technically a tapestry, but this is a different story. It\u0026rsquo;s a 70 meters long embroidered cloth which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England. It was supposedly made in the 11th century, a few years after the Battle of Hastings.\nThe tapestry consists of about 60 scenes, like in a comic book, and was meant to be displayed annually in the Bayeux Cathedral so all the citizens could learn about the epic victories of William, Duke of Normandy. Now it\u0026rsquo;s exhibited in a specific museum with some interesting information about its construction and design. This museum is also sized for hundreds of tourists, and it was great to be able to enjoy it almost alone. The audioguide of the museum is mandatory, not only because of the detailed information that it provides but also because the locution of the guide forces you to go along the cloth following the story. A clever way to shepherd tourists.\n Bayeux Embroidery or Bayeux Tapestry   Caen In order to reach Mont Saint-Michel before the high tide, we dedicated Caen less time than it would normally deserve. We crossed the town center, viewing from the outside the main attractions: the Church of St. Etienne (a.k.a. the Men\u0026rsquo;s Abbey), the Church of Ste. Trinité (a.k.a. the Women\u0026rsquo;s Abbey) and the Château de Caen, that hosts a couple of museums that we would have visited if only we had 2-3 more hours to spare.\n Caen   Mont Saint-Michel A lot of people recommended us to spend the night inside the island of Mont Saint-Michel, even someone said that ideally you should spend two nights: one outside to view the island from the land and another one inside. This is a very poor recommendation, in my opinion.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I was disappointed with the Mont Saint-Michel, on the contrary I loved it, but it\u0026rsquo;s extremely expensive and I don\u0026rsquo;t see the value of spending even one night inside. We slept in one of the handful of small hotels inside the rock, and for us it was not very abusive but the price of the same room during the high season was more than 400 euros, with an additional 19€ per person for the breakfast.\nThe restaurants were, as the hotels, very scarce and therefore very expensive. Normal menus for 40, 60 or even 80€. The specialty is a giant French omelette, normally with nothing at all (for about 25-30€) but sometimes with other ingredients as cheese, mushroom or even lobster, asking for up to 75€ per omelette. Ridiculous.\nFor the first time in the trip, we saw there several tourist groups but it was clearly below the normal occupation. Maybe in Spring or Summer it has more value to spend one night, as it can be the only way to walk by the streets, the walls or the abbey without crowds everywhere.\nFor me, the most impressive part is not the tides and the water going up and down covering the entrance to the island. The most impressive part is the abbey internals. In order to place the transept crossing of the church on top of the mount they had to build a lot of chambers, crypts and corridors to sustain the upper floors of the Abbey (and the church on top of everything). Again, it\u0026rsquo;s impressive the amount of logistical and technological talent wasted in superstitions.\nBonus recommendation: Spend some hours during the day, being aware of the tides schedule to see at least one high tide, but don\u0026rsquo;t spend the night. The visit to the abbey takes about 2h, and the rest of the mount can be seen calmly in another 60-90 minutes, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need more than 4-5 hours to see everything properly and leave with your wallet as harmless as possible.\n Mont Saint-Michel at night   Follow the link to read about the rest of the trip through Brittany.\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "Last week I attended Big Data Spain (BDS), a renowned event focused particularly on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It\u0026rsquo;s a reference event about Big Data, not only in Spain but across Europe. The event is almost entirely held in English and attracts top level speakers and public.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t take a lot of notes, but I\u0026rsquo;ll summarize the talks that deserve your attention (among those that I heard):\nTalks Artificial Intelligence and Data-centric businesses, by Óscar Mendez (Stratio)\nThe first keynote was the typical inspirational talk to open an event. Óscar focused on the growing relevance of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. It\u0026rsquo;d be curious to compare it with the opening keynote from previous years, the revolution is always just around the corner.\nAnyway, Óscar gave some interesting concepts. I specially liked the way he explained the next relevant disruptions:\n First disruption, use big data also for Operational purposes (and this is the key, IMHO) Second disruption, use distributed applications via microservices Third disruption, smart data centers moving first to IaaS and then to PaaS  @omendezsoto talking about the future of #bigdata and #ai with microservices and containers, great message of flexibility and growth. #BDS17 pic.twitter.com/0i1b7oyemc\n\u0026mdash; Michael McCune (@FOSSjunkie) November 16, 2017  Big Data, Analytics, and Tax Fraud - José Borja Tomé (Agencia Tributaria)\nJosé Borja started with the disclaimer \u0026ldquo;As you can imagine, I\u0026rsquo;m not here to show you how to pay less taxes\u0026rdquo;, and just with that he got all my attention and friendship. He also explained, for the greater tranquility of the Spanish audience, that Agencia Tributaria (the Spanish Tax Agency) is trying to modernize itself in terms of combating fraud and help the tax payers fill in the required forms. He delivered this messages with some slides that looked like they were made with Office 95 but the important thing is the content, not the appearance.\nHe ended his talk with several surprising and exciting figures. For example, and according to his own figures, Spain performs better (despite our usual perception) than the EU-27 median regarding the difference between the VAT that should be payed and the one that is really payed.\n Jose Borja - The difference between the VAT that should be payed and the one that is really payed in the EU-27   Big Data security: Facing the challenge, by Carlos Gomez (Stratio)\nCarlos gave a technical overview of how to protecting the data and services of a company in a Big Data environment when everything is data-centric. He summarized that it is distributed in two areas: protect the data and protect the service. You should review this talk if you are in the security business.\nListening to Carlos Gómez\u0026#39;s master class about how to securize a BigData platform #BDS17 pic.twitter.com/RoSebEwqVc\n\u0026mdash; Daniel Carroza (@danielcsant) November 16, 2017  Playing Well Together: Big Data beyond the JVM w/Spark etc, by Holden Karau (Google)\nHolden gave several good tips and tricks about Apache Spark in general, and specifically about using it from outside the Java ecosystem in Python. As a Python connoisseur, but not a Spark user (yet), I just learned a couple of usable tips but the talk was great anyway and it was a pleasure to meet Holden.\n#BDS17 @holdenkarau starts reminding everyone that we all come from different places, and this is great!! :-) pic.twitter.com/Sceqz0oh8I\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) November 16, 2017  Why big data didn’t end causal inference, by Totte Harinen (Uber)\nThis talk was one of the most promising for me after reviewing the schedule a couple of days before the event. Several years ago there were rumours of the death of causal inference at the hands of Big Data. The main reasons why Big Data might have done it are:\n Humans are bad at coming up with causal hypotheses Correlational models form a more accurate picture of reality Data analysis just seems to be headed towards the correlational approach  According to the speaker, causal inference is today more relevant than it’s ever been. In fact, bigger data normally implies a better causal inference and not the opposite. Also, Big Data findings can inspire causal hypotheses and Machine Learning methods can help us to estimate causal quantities.\nI probably will watch again this talk if the video is published.\n Totte Harinen - Some general ways in which Big Data and causal inference complement each other   Towards biologically plausible deep learning, by Nikolay Manchev (IBM)\nAnother of my favorite talks of this BDS, and very difficult to summarize. Nikolay reviewed where deep learning currently stands, what are the current limitations and challenges, and how neuroscience and psychology can bring us closer to human-level intelligence (or even beyond).\n Nikolay Manchev - Deep Learning performance vs human-level performance in object recognition tasks   Foundations of streaming SQL – learn to love stream \u0026amp; table theory, by Tyler Akidau (Google)\nTyler based his session on a very simple but interesting concept: \u0026ldquo;Tables are data at rest, Streams are data in motion\u0026rdquo;. He explained why it\u0026rsquo;s important to know perfectly the status of the data at each stage, and how to make the most of both data structures mastering the operations and transformations between streams and tables.\n Tyler Akidau - Tables are data at rest, Streams are data in motion   The Data Errors we Make, by Sean J. Taylor (Facebook)\nThis was a surprisingly interesting talk, despite I entered the room with very low expectations. In summary, Sean emphasized the necessity to think about errors, to prevent them and to estimate the uncertainty based on the fact that there will always be errors. He gave several examples and some useful tips and tricks.\n#BDS17 very interesting insights from @seanjtaylor explaining his experience dealing with Data Errors in Facebook pic.twitter.com/W9aiJpP2or\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) November 17, 2017  AI in VR, by Michael Ludden (IBM Watson)\nthis session was very funny and interesting. Michael summarized the current ecosystem regarding AI in VR, explained the current approaches to AI (and the pros and cons of each) and even made some predictions about what will happen in the future.

I attended a couple of years between 2012 and 2014, but I ceased attending because the content seemed too focused on marketing and business. This year I have finished (again) with a similar feeling, but at least some of the sessions were worth the visit. Anyway, the event itself is much more professional than in the past and everything looked controlled and very well organized. I\u0026rsquo;ll consider attending again next year.\n",

    "body": "For many different reasons I have had to discuss quite a lot recently about the professionalism of some people, technical and non-technical. Sometimes, because a person feels that she (I will use the feminine as neutral gender) is not being treated fairly with respect of her category, or because her performance is disappointing for others, sometimes after unfair comparisons between colleagues, \u0026hellip; As a common element, a diabolical concept was almost always being misused in these situations: Seniority.\nHaving several years of experience does not make you a better engineer per se. A very common case is that someone has experience with something but knows nothing (or knows little) about everything else. Worse than that, in some organizations the senior label is even used almost automatically to justify a promotion or a salary raise after a certain amount of years in the same job.\nAbout 5 years ago John Allspaw (former CTO at Etsy) wrote an article called On Being a Senior Engineer that has aged very well. I would sign that article today, as it details perfectly what could be the differences between a senior engineer and a mature engineer. As the author says, you can expect a senior engineer to be a mature engineer, but sadly it\u0026rsquo;s not always like this.\nIn his article (I recommend its complete reading) Allspaw describes a list of traits or characteristics of mature engineers:\n Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates, and are always trying to get better at it Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don’t know they do Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions Mature engineers don’t practice CYAE (“Cover Your Ass Engineering”) Mature engineers are empathetic Mature engineers are aware of cognitive biases  The first thing that you need to realize is that almost all the characteristics described are non-technical. Allspaw article can be can be summarized in this quote:\nBeing able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multi-threaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won’t matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes If I had to choose, I\u0026rsquo;ll always pick a mature engineer over any so-called senior (or even ninja!) in a particular technology or programming language. In fact, I would not change a good junior for a ninja, but that is another story that will have to be told in another moment.\n",

    "body": "This is the fifth and last part of my chronicle about our trip through the Romantikstraße, you can read the rest here:\n Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (1 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (2 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (3 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (4 of 5)  Day 5 Our last stage started in Obertraun and ended in Madrid. After a fabulous trip around Austria, we decided to spent our last morning in a quite different environment, visiting the Mauthausen memorial.\nMauthausen The Mauthausen concentration camp (1938-1945) was one of the first massive concentration camps in Nazi Germany, and the last to be liberated by the Allies. The construction started just two weeks after the Anschluss, when Austria was annexed into the Third Reich. Since the beginning it was labeled as Stufe III (Grade III), which meant that it was intended to be one of the toughest camps, and never lost this horrible classification. Mauthausen was mainly used for incarceration and extermination through labour of political prisoners, forced to work both in the expansion of the camp itself and in granite quarries nearby. Their daily lives were shaped by hunger, arbitrary violence and death.\nThe main complex in Mauthausen was declared national memorial site in 1949 and it\u0026rsquo;s also a museum since 1975, 30 years after the camp\u0026rsquo;s liberation. As they state in the web:\nThe Mauthausen Memorial is a former crime scene, a place of memory, a cemetery for the mortal remains of thousands of those murdered here and, increasingly, a site of political and historical education. Its task is to ensure public awareness of the history of the Mauthausen concentration camp and its subcamps, the memory of its victims, and the responsibility borne by the perpetrators and onlookers. At the same time it seeks to promote public critical engagement with this history in the context of its significance for the present and future. The visit is completely free and you only need to pay for the guided tours and workshops, although there is a free audioguide app for the complete memorial and museum. We chose the latter option and it was very useful and interesting.\nSeveral weeks have passed since our visit and I still remember perfectly the sensations that I experienced there. In addition, we had the bad luck that it started raining when we arrived and halfway through the visit it started to rain very very hard. I have seldom seen so much rain. Maybe it was good luck, because it forced us to stay inside the barracks and prevented us to hear anything else but rain and thunders despite being surrounded by groups of visitors in other buildings. The climate was aligned with the sad and withered spirit of the place.\n Mauthausen wreaths   Before entering the remains of the concentration camp, the visitor has to cross a couple of dozen memorials, erected by various countries and collectives that lost their citizens in Mauthausen. Curiously, some of these countries no longer exist (like Yugoslavia), others did not exist at that time (like Ukraine) and most striking of all, one of the memorials is dedicated directly to the Spanish Republicans (as you can see in the featured image), since several thousand political prisoners from the Republican side were taken there. Some memorials were large and epic, others small and humble, but all were breathtaking.\nEven now in 2017, there was not a single flag of Spain in the whole camp other than the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) one, even inside the secular chapel where the flags from all the victims waved. I think it is a lovely and wise gesture.\n Spanish Second Republic flag in Mauthausen   Thanks to the deluge, during the last part of the visit we had the camp practically empty for us.\n Mauthausen panoramic   After having visited Auschwitz last year, the visit to the rest of the concentration camp inflicted less impression on me. Some anecdotes and brutal events of Mauthausen are unique, but both the figures and how to show what happened at Auschwitz are much more overwhelming.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into more details about the camp itself to avoid any spoiler. Mauthausen is an essential visit whether you have visited other concentration camps or not. Please go.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Last week I had the huge pleasure to participate in a week-long Security Summer Camp organized by the Information Security department of ING Spain. The agenda was very promising and implied some theory and lots of practice, ending with an Escape the Room game and a 2,5 days long Capture The Flag hacking competition. Several speakers from the Infosec Squad prepared talks and workshops about different topics, focusing on Ethical Hacking, secure development, server hardening or OSINT.\nEverything was perfectly prepared and organized. I\u0026rsquo;ll remark (as her colleagues also did) the invaluable effort of Martina Matarí (@da3n3rys) coordinating everything. She also prepared a talk, the Escape the Room and the CTF competition by herself. Thanks Martina and company, it was impressive!!\nLet me also say that it\u0026rsquo;s worthy of praise for a company like ING to allow and promote this kind of events, held mostly in working hours for more than 70-80 participants.\nTalks and Workshops Sleeping with the Enemy: Ethical Hacking workshop Beatriz Portela (@usr0000) gave a series of workshops focusing on the most common and basic vectors of attack, learning what a vulnerability is and how to take advantage of it.\nServer hardening Sergi Llorente explained how to protect a server from malicious attackers: DDoS prevention, firewall policies, optimal configurations, password and banning policies and even physical attacks prevention policies. Very complete, and ended with a contest asking all the audience to infiltrate a prepared virtual machine with a weak spot, retrieving the admin password and getting access to a console with admin rights on it.\nSecure development Daniel Medianero (@dmedianero) prepared a good combination of theory and practice regarding bad smells and vulnerabilities in code, both in backend and frontend. He even prepared an online survey for the audience to vote if a given code snippet presented a vulnerability and of what kind. It was very educational and entertaining.\nVicente Carreras (@vicentecarreras) checked if the attendees listened carefuly enough in Daniel\u0026rsquo;s talks with a contest by teams.\nOSINT, don\u0026rsquo;t be part of it Martina Matarí (@da3n3rys) talked about Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the danger it entails and what proactive methods exist to monitor it and specially to stop being a part of it.\nEscape the Room Sadly I couldn\u0026rsquo;t participate, but everyone said it was awesome. I\u0026rsquo;ll just leave you with a glimpse:\nCon esto, un bot de @telegram y mucho ingenio se ha currado @da3n3rys un pedazo de #ScapeRoom 🔦🔒🔑 pic.twitter.com/HrM1ydDAmt\n\u0026mdash; 𝑩𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒛 🏴‍☠️ (@usr0000) July 21, 2017  Capture The Flag I was enrolled in the CTF since I signed up for the Summer Camp, but after a hard week with a lot of issues (work related and not) I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I was going to contribute properly to my team. All it took was for Martina to subtly insist and I forgot about the weariness and recovered my eagerness to participate. Anyway, I had plans to stay at home during the weekend.\nFor those who don\u0026rsquo;t know what a Capture The Flag is (in this context), I\u0026rsquo;ll copy the description from the cfttime.org site:\nCapture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed. Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. Team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. The next task in chain can be opened only after some team solve previous task. Then the game time is over sum of points shows you a CTF winer. Famous example of such CTF is DEF CON CTF quals.\nWell, attack-defence is another interesting kind of competitions. Here every team has own network (or only one host) with vulnarable services. Your team has time for patching your services and developing exploits usually. So, then organizers connects participants of competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for defence points and hack opponents for attack points. Historically this is a first type of CTFs, everybody knows about DEF CON CTF - something like a World Cup of all other competitions.\nMixed competitions may vary possible formats. It may be something like wargame with special time for task-based elements (like UCSB iCTF).\nCTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security: cryptography, stego, binary analysis, reverse engeneering, mobile security and others. Good teams generally have strong skills and experience in all these issues.\n The participation on this competition was lower than for the rest of the Summer Camp, as expected taking place in the weekend. From my team (randomly selected from all participants) we were only two of us left. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know my partner, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop us from organizing ourselves quickly to start solving problems from the same Friday evening. From the beginning I discovered that my partner was a bright and hard working guy, and soon we understood each other very well (Jaume eres un crack).\nThe challenge was a Jeopardy-style CTF and consisted on solving tasks with difficulties from 1 to 5 distributed in several categories. Each solved task represented a conquered country (as you can see in the map). Optionally, the first team to conquer a country gets more points than the rest. The categories where:\n Criptography - cryptography tests, from basic to advanced ones Forensics - Forensic analysis from network logs, mobile images and other operating systems Quiz - Questions about hacker culture Reconnaissance - Searching for people, machines, websites or data starting only with small hints Reverse engineering - Cracking several kinds of files Steganography - Finding hidden messages in known file formats Web Hacking - Putting into practice what was learned during the ethical hacking talks  I won\u0026rsquo;t spoil here any of the tasks, I\u0026rsquo;ll only say that for a level 2 cryptography task I spent around 3-4 hours on Sunday. It took me several steps with different types of encryption (which you had to guess) to get the final result (with great relief and joy). There are a lot of examples in the Internet and for some of them you can even find the solution published by a participant.\nIt was thrilling, very very funny and I learned a lot. The other participants had very good level and competition was fierce. We struggled to lead the scoreboard almost all the tournament, we managed to solve almost all the tasks to avoid a comeback from our pursuers and finally WE WON! Go StarHack Team!!!\nHere you have the Final Scoreboard. It can be observed that there was scoring activity during almost all the weekend, nights included. Kudos for all the participants :-)\n ING CTF 2017 - Final Scoreboard   The prize for the winners (I discovered it on Monday, I did not care during the contest) was a fabulous Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Pack. Now I have three different Raspi devices so I need ideas, I\u0026rsquo;m taking advantage of one of them only :-)\n",

Quite off our route because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything affordable in Mondsee. We wanted a good place to rest after a hard day 3, and Lauterbacher was more than good. The place itself was nice and the owners were marvelous with us. I\u0026rsquo;ll seriously consider returning to this place if I ever come back to the region.\nAnd thus it began the most awaited stage of the trip.\nPostalm On our way to Hallstatt we droved through Postalm, a mountain pass which is part of a very well preserved and protected Natural Park. Just to cross the area you need to pay a tax (5€ per adult, 2 per children and so on). Normally you\u0026rsquo;ll pay to spend the morning, the day or the weekend inside: it\u0026rsquo;s full of hiking routes, mountain bike tracks and even several ski slopes for the winter.\nAs it was early in the morning, it was almost empty. We only came across a couple of cars and several herds of cows. The scenery was beautiful: everything was green, mist here and there, and almost no sign of mankind except a few piles of stacked wood and the road itself.\n Postalm, paradise of Solitude and Nature   I loved the place, although we only stopped a couple of times to make pictures. Another place that I hope to return in the future with my hiking equipment.\nGosau Our next stop was Gosau. We also spent less time than expected here, we were eager to arrive Hallstatt as soon as possible. We crossed the town a couple of times, made some pictures, visited a lake,\u0026hellip; great if it was not what we had been doing the past three days.\n The catholic and evangelist churches, disputing the valley in Gosau   Hallstatt And finally, we arrived Hallstatt, the main destination of the entire trip. I generally liked it and of course it\u0026rsquo;s very beautiful, but I must say that it might be overrated (IMHO).\nThe first thing that we did was to go up to the Salz Welten (Salt World) complex using a funicular. The views were as amazing as this during the climb:\n Southern part of Hallstatt, with the Salzbergbahn station   Right after ascending you\u0026rsquo;ll find what they call the World Heritage View (with the corresponding restaurant and souvenir shop): an impressive viewpoint from which you can see much of the Hallstätter See lake and just below, small (because it is small) the old town of Hallstatt on the lake shore.\n Hallstatt World Heritage View, with a group selfie using a drone    \u0026#39;Miners\u0026#39; sheltering from the rain in the Hallstatt Salt Mine   They claim that the Hallstatt Salt Mine is the oldest salt mine in Europe, but what they have there is more a tourist trap (as we guessed beforehand) than an historical or practical recreation. Yes, during the visit you go underground and they even give you a miner outfit, but the visit consists almost exclusively of videos and light effects.\nWhat makes the visit unique are wooden slides by which you descend from some galleries to others. It\u0026rsquo;s curious, but after the second one it\u0026rsquo;s not that thrilling and with a big group visiting the mines it\u0026rsquo;s bottleneck after bottleneck. These slides are the reason behind the miner outfit, because apart of them the risk of staining or tearing your clothes is null. A curious thing, being a mine.\nBut maybe I\u0026rsquo;m biased, after visiting in 2016 the Wieliczka Salt Mine in Poland, near Krakow. Wieliczka is a really huge mine, the areas that are visitable are much more impressive and the information is infinite times more interesting.\nLuckily for you as future visitors, the funicular ticket to visit at least the World Heritage View can be purchased separately from the entrance to the mines.\nWith that bittersweet flavor, we went down again to visit the old town, full of restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops. The best approach to visit Hallstatt is to lose yourself in its streets, alleys and stairs. I liked some hidden corners more than the typical streets or squares. In fact, what could be a very cool area for visitors (next to the church) is used as parking and therefore is full of cars. Cars and vans can be seen on any postcard picture, as this one:\n Hallstatt from the \u0026#39;postcard picture\u0026#39; spot   And I say postcard picture because since you enter the town there are signs for you to go to the spot from which the postcard picture can be made. Looks like the spot it\u0026rsquo;s important for them, so I added the viewpoint to OpenStreetMap :-)\nWe took dozens of postcard pictures and postcard selfies, struggling to avoid that other tourists could appear. It was packed full of people.\nA very cool thing about Hallstatt is that the cemetery is located between the houses that surround the catholic church. There is so little place to bury people there that every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an ossuary, to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the deceased\u0026rsquo;s name, profession and date of death inscribed on them is on display in a small chapel.\n Hallstatt Beinhaus, where you can show off your skull forever   Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s possible to leave written in your will that you want your skull to end there. Think about it.\nObertraun We ended the day (and we could also say our Romantikstraße trip) in Obertraun, another touristic place just in front of Hallstatt in the lakeshore. Obertraun also has it\u0026rsquo;s own funicular with caves, mines and breath-taking views, the Dachstein Salzkammergut, but as it was raining and very foggy we prefered to stay in the lakeshore.\nDespite the heavy rain and the mist, we took a couple of glasses of the wine we had bought in Kremsmünster and went for a walk. In the lakeshore there were several floating platforms, ready to receive bathers in the summer. We toured the entire village and we even entered a small forest in the mouth of the Koppentraun river to search for a cache (and it was worth it!).\nAfter starting to worry about not find any open restaurant, we discovered the perfect place (and it was beside our hotel): Kegelbahn, a restaurant with typical local food, and a small bowling alley! After a delicious onion soup, a superb goulash and an exquisite cheesecake, we occupied the bowling alley until they closed the place. It was such a fun and unexpected moment.\n In Obertraun, throwing bowls like there\u0026#39;s no tomorrow   Our visit on the fifth and last day is not strictly part of the Romantikstraße route, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be part of my review anyway.\nStay tuned for the last episode!\n",

We wanted to take advantage of our rental car and Salzbug deserves to be visited more calmly (and you don\u0026rsquo;t need a car to go there). For similar reasons, we also ruled out going to the Hohenwerfen Castle.\nI think it was the right decision, because it allowed us to make the most of the remaining of our road trip.\nSankt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut Sankt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut is one of the most touristic places of Austria. I suspect that I\u0026rsquo;d have preferred to visit this town 15-20 years ago, now it\u0026rsquo;s excessively exploited touristically. In the narrow streets of the center I had the feeling of being inside a theme park, and unfortunately one with many more shops than attractions. It is possible that the shops and restaurants themselves are nowadays the attractions. Not for me.\n Schafbergbahn trains crossing   But still we had a great time there.\nWe started the day by climbing on the Schafbergbahn, a rack railway leading in the warmer half of the year from almost the lakeshore of the Wolfgangsee lake to the summit of the Schafberg mountain (1,783 m). From the viewpoints of Schafberg it is possible to see 9 of the main lakes of Austria, countless mountains and an infinite 360º landscape.\nInitially it reminded me to a small version of the Jungfraubahn, which I visited in 2013. Saving the differences because the Jungfraujoch station is the highest station in Europe (3,454 m), the line is more than twice as long and the amount of visitors is probably exponentially greater in the Jungfrau.\nUnfortunately, due to some construction works in the railway, the train only reached the Schafbergalpe (1,363 m), an intermediate railway halt with a big guest house, a couple of private houses and traces of many hiking trails.\nDespite not being on the mountaintop, the views were overwhelming. We wandered around the area, taking lots of pictures but as you can imagine they don\u0026rsquo;t capture the feeling of being up there surrounded by such a wonderful environment. For my next visit I promise to bring adequate equipment to do some hiking route.\n Staring into the endless mountains at Schafbergalpe   After the descent came one of the funniest moments of the trip. As we saw in many other places, on the lakeshore of Sankt Wolfgang there were some boat-rental locations. Instead of renting a paddle boat, we chose an small boat with electric engine to try to make a longer trip through the Wolfgangsee lake. In the end, our boat wasn\u0026rsquo;t much faster than a paddle boat but at least could entertain ourselves doing the clown on board instead of pedaling.\nNote to my wise readers: What translation to English do you suggest for \u0026ldquo;hacer el pertur\u0026rdquo;?\n Sailing on the Wolfgangsee   Apart from amusing ourselves stupidly, from the boat we could contemplate the town from its best perspective. In the next picture you can perfectly see what I mean, a postcard view with the main landmarks: the catholic Church of Sainkt Wolfgang and the Im Weißen Rößl (The White Horse Inn). The inn (now an expensive hotel with a couple of fine restaurants) is very popular for a successful operetta of the same name in which the protagonist is a bartender of the inn desperately in love with the owner of The White Horse. The show has been performed several times mainly across Germany and Austria, but in the 1930s it was even featured on Broadway and the West End of London. There are also several movie and TV series adaptations.\n Postcard picture of Sainkt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut, with the Church of Sainkt Wolfgang and the Im Weißen Rößl (the yellow building)   We tried to escape from the tourist traps as much as we could, but in Sainkt Wolfgang it was a really difficult task to achieve. Finally we had lunch in Hubertuskeller. It was very good and not absurdly expensive.\nBad Ischl For the afternoon we improvised a visit to Bad Ischl and it was our main mistake of the trip, but it was our fault and not because the city is not interesting.\nThe center of Bad Ischl is very beautiful and it\u0026rsquo;s very well maintained, but the main attraction is the Kaiservilla, summer residence of the Austrian Imperial family, and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it because it was closed. The town is also famous for it\u0026rsquo;s salt mines and offers several health spas, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to enjoy them. We walked through the center, we searched for a couple of caches and we left to reach Mondsee before sunset.\n Post Office and the Trinkhalle in Bad Ischl   Mondsee Mondsee is famous for the Mondsee Abbey and the Basilica of Saint Michael, inside which it was filmed the wedding scene of the film The Sound of Music. We did not arrive in time to visit the church but at least we managed to quietly stroll around the village.\nFollowing a recommendation we tasted a local variety of wine and an assortment of local cheeses, and they were good but nothing special. We enjoyed particularly the Strandpromenade, from which we could see the sunset falling on the Mondsee lake. I\u0026rsquo;ve just discovered in Wikipedia that Mondsee is one of Austria\u0026rsquo;s last privately owned lakes. In August 2008, the owner announced it was up for sale. WTF! Fucking Private Property!!\nExcept for some detail, Mondsee is similar to other towns we had already visited in our trip, but surely it is worth spending more time here.\n Waiting for the sunset at the Mondsee lakeshore   We were not able to find a reasonably priced accommodation here so we booked something about 20 km away and off our route, and surprisingly there we met the most incredible host in the world. But this story belongs to our next day\u0026hellip;\nStay tuned for next episodes!\n",

    "body": "This is the second part of my chronicle about our trip through the Romantikstraße, you can read the rest here:\n Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (1 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (3 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (4 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (5 of 5)  Day 2 Kremsmünster For me, Kremsmünster Abbey was the most positive surprise of the entire trip. A priori it looked like yet another abbey, and our first hour there not only was confirming that suspicion but also made us feel somewhat deceived. We paid a considerable amount of money to find out that the ticket didn\u0026rsquo;t include the visit of what we particularly wanted to see in there: The Tassilo Chalice, the Library and the Mathematical Tower. We could only access the public areas and the inner gardens where they temporally hosted a floral exhibition. The information was confusing, mostly in German only, and the variety of ticket options was the most complex that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen in a place like this.\n Kremsmünster Mathematical Tower   After visiting the gardens and the Abbey Church we followed some unclear signs to the Tassilo, and when we were almost there a couple of exhibition guides insisted us that our tickets didn\u0026rsquo;t include this area, so they charged us again (without any kind of ticket) to enter the Treasure Chamber and a couple more rooms with minor interest. The Tassilo is an interesting piece of art and history, but the extra price to see it seemed disproportionate.\nWe were about to leave, almost angry, but in the end we bought another additional ticket to visit the panorama terrace on top of the Mathematical Tower even though it only included climbing up the stairs and going out on the terrace to see the views from there. The rest of the building was not included in our handful of tickets but at least we\u0026rsquo;d see some of what we initially wanted.\nAnd there, waiting at the entrance of the tower, our luck changed with the stellar appearance of Anna. I\u0026rsquo;ll call her Anna as the most popular female name in Austria to preserve her identity, not because I don\u0026rsquo;t remember her real name.\nThe incredible kindness of Anna, her desire to practice spoken English and the fact that there were no more tourists in the visit, made our day radically better. Waiting to see if anyone else was joining the visit we told her about our bad luck and poor understanding of the information for tourists, and she empathized and wanted to compensate us in some way. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t realize that we\u0026rsquo;d bought like three different tickets to leave without seeing what we expected to see (the main attractions, by the way).\n Xylotheque - Sternwarte Kremsmünster Source: Reinhard Stiksel in Wikimedia  - CC License   We climbed the Tower, but instead of going directly to the top we stopped at each floor and briefly visited the exhibition rooms. One room was a small Natural History collection with several stuffed animals, minerals, all kind of insects, other contained an interesting collection of vintage astronomical devices and globes, another presented diverse regional folklore, ethnology and popular costumes,\u0026hellip; We didn\u0026rsquo;t make any picture acknowledging that the visit was unofficial, but I can still remember an amazing cabinet with a curious Xylotheque, pieces of different types of wood carved as books that contained their characteristic leaf, fruit or flower. I\u0026rsquo;d found a picture in Wikimedia, take a look right here.\nAnna\u0026rsquo;s infinite friendliness did not end there. On our way down she offered to negotiate for us a private visit to the Library, guided by herself. She managed to convince her boss, and paying an additional ticket at a reduced price we got to see the rest of the art collections and the impressive Library. We visited the Imperial Hall, several rooms with a nice art collection (mainly paintings) and finally the Library. We could\u0026rsquo;ve spent hours there\u0026hellip;\n Kremsmünster Library   We\u0026rsquo;d planned to be in Kremsmünster just a couple of hours , but finally we were there all morning so we had to lunch just there, in a traditional restaurant inside the Abbey grounds: Stiftsschank. It was great so we recommend it as well.\nScharnstein Scharnstein stands out for its variety of hiking trails, since it\u0026rsquo;s surrounded by forests and mountains. It\u0026rsquo;s also near Totes Gebirge, a picturesque mountain range part of the Limestone Alps.\nOur extended visit to the Kremsmünster Abbey forced us to expend less time here, but at least we could do some light hiking. We made one of the typical routes: climbing from the town to the ruins of the Scharnstein Castle. Both the ascent and the exploration of the ruins were fantastic. We were lucky enough to be completely alone, so it was a relaxing experience and a total immersion in the Nature that surrounded us. The views were excellent, with the remains of the castle with the huge Almtal valley behind.\n Relaxing at Scharnstein Castle   In Scharnstein you can also find an interesting Criminological Museum. We went there but it was closed, so we settled for a beer in a tavern located in the same Scharnstein Castle that hosts the Museum about Crime and another about the Austrian Federal Gendarmerie. The tavern was promising but they\u0026rsquo;ll have to admit that it has seen better days.\nTraunkirchen Our next stop was Traunkirchen, a small village known for its idyllic location on a small peninsula overlooking the Traunsee Lake. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the place where we took more pictures per minute, and that\u0026rsquo;s considering that the best pictures of the village are made from the lake itself. It was a short walk, but it was totally worth it.\nOn our way there we booked with our mobile a guest house in other village. If we had seen the Das Traunsee Seehotel before\u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;d have spent the night there regardless of how much we were charged, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem cheap. The views and the back terrace of the hotel were incredible.\n A pier in Traunkirchen with the Traunstein mountain behind   Gmunden We planned to end our second stage in Gmunden, the most important town of the region and where the Traun River empties into the Traunsee Lake, at the foot of the Traunstein mountain and near the beautiful village of Traunkirchen. Yes, I agree with you, this village should\u0026rsquo;ve been called Traun Town.\nGmunden is a very lively town with a lot of summer resorts, shops, art galleries and restaurants. Curiously, most of the fashion boutiques exclusively had Austrian regional costumes on display on the storefronts. I left there with a real desire to buy one, they were splendid. During our visit it was very peaceful, but it was clear that it\u0026rsquo;s a popular tourist destination. The old town is surrounded by countless houses of all sizes from modest chalets to small palaces.\nIn the western lakeside, in front of the mouth of the Traun River and connected with the downtown through the Esplananade (a nice long promenade) is located the biggest attraction of the town: the Schloss Ort Castle. This singular Austrian Castle is set on a small island offshore, so it can only be reached by a long timber bridge. This 120m bridge starts from a beautiful green peninsula called the Toscana Park. We took a delightful walk through the park by the water\u0026rsquo;s edge where each stop seemed a special viewpoint and provided a unique perspective.\n Gmunden\u0026#39;s Schloss Ort Castle   We had dinner at the Weinhaus Spiesberger, conceivably the best tavern in town where Agatha dined, guess what, Traun Fische! We did not quite understand what kind of fish it was, as in the UK when you order Fish \u0026amp; chips and almost nobody is capable of telling you the specific type of fish. Anyway, it was a seasonal fish from the Lake (or so the said) and it was good so I also recommend this place at least for a beer.\nStay tuned for next episodes!\n",

    "body": "A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of making a road trip through Austria following what they call the Romantikstraße, Romantic Road or Romantic Trail in English. Interestingly, ours was a singles trip initially planned for three friends but sadly in the end we were only two because at the last minute Roberto had to cancel. I shared this great adventure only with Agatha and it was great (as expected). I suppose that in the eyes of any innkeeper or bartender we were a happy couple celebrating something.\nHaving said that, I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any special romantic atmosphere beyond the surrounding beautiful landscapes, fantastic lakes and awesome mountains. Some might say that my sense of romanticism is broken, and it may be possible, but for me Nature is not romantic by itself. Luckily the shops, restaurants and villages in general didn\u0026rsquo;t focus on selling this concept to the visitors. In fact it was very unlikely to find a sign about the Romantikstraße off the main roads of the route. But enough talking about the commercial name of the route.\nLet me summarize our experience, mainly anecdotes and tips. Prices, timetables and other General tourist information are easy to find and that info sometimes expires soon. I\u0026rsquo;ll love to read it in the future and it could be useful for anyone planning a similar trip. You can also read Agatha\u0026rsquo;s review in her blog (in Spanish). She prepared the route perfectly in advance and we mainly followed her plan, we only needed a couple of improvised detours.\nTL;DR  The area covered by the Romantikstraße is totally amazing. Everything is beautiful, looks shiny, deserves a zillion pictures or to sit for a while to admire the landscape. Especially the latter It\u0026rsquo;s not a cheap trip, but it\u0026rsquo;s not as expensive as Switzerland We spent 4,5 days there and it was enough but the trip deserves at least a couple days more Hallstatt is very beautiful, but it\u0026rsquo;s not (as they claim) the most beautiful village in the world. Covarrubias is (of course)  Preparing the Romantikstraße If you are not as lucky as I was and you need to prepare the trip in advance, my first recommendation is to visit the official website of the Romantikstraße. There you\u0026rsquo;ll find a lot of info about the route and the main attractions. You can also request a brochure of the route in several languages for free, we did it and it was useful during the trip.\nAbout the accommodation, depending on the dates of the trip it may be essential to book everything in advance. Some villages are very small and have few options to choose from. We booked in advance only the first night and a couple of nights we needed a considerable detour from the route, and it was low season.\nDay 1 Schallaburg After wasting more than 1 hour in the airport waiting the queue of the car rental company our first destination was the Schallaburg Castle, a \u0026gt;900 years old castle very well preserved located on top of a hill surrounded by forest. In addition to the privileged situation, the castle offers a very well arranged garden. This first stop reminded me of my bicycle trip through La Loire à Vélo.\nThe castle also hosts temporal exhibitions and a very nice restaurant in the courtyard called Schloss. Apart from the regional specialties, the restaurant changes it\u0026rsquo;s menu and decoration to match the running exhibitions. During our visit the main exhibition was about Islam and we could acclimatize to the country with a regional craft beer and some falafel.\nThe first funny anecdote of the trip arrived soon. From the parking to the castle we saw two different roads, both very steep. Ignoring a medium-sized sign in German we followed the nearest of them, because in OSMAnd I could see that it was more direct to the gardens and the castle. After visiting the garden, the courtyard of the castle, the restaurant and most of the open rooms (and some closed ones), we noticed that we had paid nothing to be there. We went back to the parking lot using the other way and confirmed that we\u0026rsquo;d skipped the ticket office. I leave to your imagination if we warned them of our mistake and paid the entrance.\n Schallaburg castle\u0026#39;s courtyard - CC License   Before leaving, we found our first cache of the trip, less than 5 meters from our car :-)\nMelk Our next visit was to Melk and his famous Melk Abbey. Umberto Eco named Adso de Melk as a tribute to this abbey, and we were curious about it and the fact that the Austrians talk about this place as one of the most important monasteries in Europe. The place did not disappoint us at all.\nWe did a quick tour through the main elements of this baroque Abbey. The exhibition, the Marble Hall and the church are quite beautiful but what really impressed us was the Library, with about 100.000 volumes (1.888 manuscripts, 750 incunabula, a unique 13th century copy of The Song of the Nibelungs, \u0026hellip;). In one room of the Library the fresco portrays an allegory of Scientia (Science), just like churches in Spain, right?\n Melk Abbey Library Source: Jorge Royan @ Wikimedia  - CC License   The Abbey was also wisely located, on top of a hill and clearly standing out from the town of Melk. The visit is worth it just for the views from the balcony connecting the Marble Hall and the Library with Melk, the Danube river and forests everywhere.\nThe visit to the Abbey includes a nice English landscape garden with an interesting baroque pavilion and a small park full of works of art and fabulous hidden corners.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to find this awesome cache in the surrounding area. One of my all time favorites.\nSteyr Our last stop for the first day was Steyr, where (as they say) Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo meet each other in harmony. Steyr is in the confluence of the rivers Enns and Steyr, and therefore features more than 100 bridges. I confess that I expected to hear the comment The Venice of Austria but it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. The old town is nice, all around the huge Stadtplatz (market square) that was, sadly, partially occupied with parked cars and even some tents for private events. Disgusting for the visitors and I\u0026rsquo;d bet that also for the locals.\n Steyr\u0026#39;s Nachtwachtern - CC License   Our main goal in this city was to follow the Nachtwächtern Tour, a walking tour through the old town guided by a historian disguised as medieval watchman. Unluckily the tour was only in German, and we struggled to get the guide to understand that we wanted to follow him without understanding anything at all. The guide took pity on us, letting us follow him paying only half the price. As expected we didn\u0026rsquo;t understand anything, but we crossed the same streets and alleys, we looked where they looked, we analyzed in detail whatever they commented in detail, and we laughed when they laughed (maybe even some joke about Spanish tourists, who knows).\nThe Night Watchman Tour is also the only way for a tourist to climb the 228 steps of the Stadtpfarrkirche Steyr tower, a roman catholic Church dedicated to Saint Aegidius (I toast him!) and Saint Koloman. Even at night, the views are wonderful.\nWe had a delicious dinner with local specialities at Mader and returned to our guest house (Gasthof Bauer). I recommend both places but especially the second one, the guest house occupied several low buildings and houses in a small island near the old town, the rooms were almost small apartments and the attention we received was exquisite.\nThis is the first part of my chronicle about our trip through the Romantikstraße, you can read the rest here:\n Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (2 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (3 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (4 of 5) Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (5 of 5)  Stay tuned for next episodes!\n",

    "title": "Baking my Blog with JBake and GitHub",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "Almost since I created my personal blog in 2003 I thought about moving it from blogger to my own domain, private hosting and so on. My laziness prevented me from doing so. Not because the migration itself, but for the maintenance it entailed.\nAnyhow, I was determined to migrate my blog outside of any blogging platform. I wanted to have complete control over my content, but without wasting lots of time in maintenance. All I needed was a way to do it seamlessly, quickly, and as automated as possible.\nThe static site/blog generators appeared a long time ago but now they are multiplying and flourishing. I watched them and the surrounding tools for a long time\u0026hellip; and recently my atheist prayers were heard!\nI will describe briefly what I did to move my blog from blogger to Github Pages in a few hours. The most time consuming task was to decide among a large number of excellent static site generators.\nStep 1 - Choose your weapon The reference here is StaticGen, a ranking with all the open source static site generators. The site itself is open source, and static generated (of course) using Middleman.\nIn StaticGen you will need some time, filtering by programming language, sorting the options by stars, forks, \u0026hellip; Eventually you\u0026rsquo;ll chose one that covers your needs mainly in terms of language, templating technology or license.\nI was tempted to use Hugo but I selected JBake (created in 2013 by Jonathan Bullock) instead of other much more popular options. The main reasons for me were:\n It\u0026rsquo;s Open Source (MIT License). This is always the first element in my checklist It\u0026rsquo;s cross platform, one of the main benefits to choose a product running in the JVM, right? Supports a good amount of content formats: plain HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, \u0026hellip; this is great now that I write even my personal notes in markdown format Interesting template support: Freemarker, Thymeleaf, Jade or Groovy template framework Blog-ready out of the box: RSS feed, tag support, archive, index pagination, \u0026hellip; Easy to integrate with CSS frameworks as Bootstrap Custom metadata in the contents, even exposed to the templates. This is winner by itself  The documentation of JBake could be improved, but it\u0026rsquo;s good enough.\nTo install JBake, you can execute the last binary distribution but I recommend that you simply use SDKMAN. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what SDKMAN is, you are missing something special. After you have SDKMAN installed, enter the following command:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; sdk install jbake Thanks Jonathan !!\nStep 2 - Choose your theme/style Some static generators support themes better than others, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. This was important to me, and I checked that in JBake the code responsible of the presentation is isolated enough from the content, so it\u0026rsquo;s more or less simple to change entirely the theme or style of your site.\nIn fact, I didn\u0026rsquo;t start the personalization of my blog from the default theme and style. I cloned the JBake Future Imperfect Template by Manik Magar and for the moment I\u0026rsquo;ve only needed minor touches to make it better suited for me.\nAs simple as this:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; mkdir awesome-jbake  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; git clone https://github.com/manikmagar/jbake-future-imperfect-template.git awesome-jbake  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; cd awesome-jbake \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls -ltr Most of the changes were related to custom css styles that I was already using in Blogger, the JBake Future Imperfect Template is fantastic.\nThanks Manik !!\nStep 3 - Migrate your content from your old blog/site (if needed) You\u0026rsquo;ll only need this if you are migrating something, skip this point if you are creating something from scratch.\nFor this magic trick, my first intent was to implement it myself, only to code for a while. Finally I discovered a repo in github with a promising name: blogger-to-jbake. I checked the code and the author (Cloud Tu) had developed more or less what I meant to do.\nWith a little help from an difficult-even-for-google-translate README file in Chinese, I could run the program and export all my blog only with minor problems regarding the download of certain images that were not hosted in blogger.\nThe steps are very simple:\n Modify the src/main/resources/application.properties to set the Blogger atom file path, the output path and your current URL in Blogger Execute gradlew run in the console Profit!  I made some improvements (from my humble point of view) in the code, and I\u0026rsquo;ll send the corresponding pull request. They could be valuable for anyone else.\nThanks Cloud Tu !!\nStep 4 - Deploy your blog Well, thanks to Github and specifically to Github Pages, the only thing that I needed was to change the configuration of JBake so the output directory for the baked content is called docs instead of the name by default (output).\nAfter enabling it for the first time, Github automatically deploys in Github Pages whatever you put in the docs directory of your repo.\nI\u0026rsquo;m suffering the misbehavior of Github Pages with relative paths, but for the moment I\u0026rsquo;m solving it with a sed command before pushing the baked content.\nThanks Github Pages !!\nConclusion I\u0026rsquo;m happier than ever with my blog, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write more often now that I can make it with my editor in Markdown or AsciiDoc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also possible that I\u0026rsquo;ll write a more technical post about how JBake works, but in the meantime ask me in the comments anything that you want to know.\n",

    "body": "  I'll keep my intent to summarize all the important events that I'm attending, and I'll do it again in English as the audience is international. Please, point me any mistake you may find  \n Greach Conference 2017   This week I attended, as usual since I don't remember when, to Greach 2017, an international conference about the Apache Groovy language and ecosystem. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it's probably one of the Top3 worldwide events about this technology.\nThe event is organized mainly by Iván López (@ilopar) and Alberto Vilches (@albertovilches), with some help from other colleagues and a lot of Sponsors. Everything was perfect: the location is great, the spaces were confortable, the wifi more or less worked fine, cafeteria in-place, free wardrobe,... the lunch boxes were far from perfect, but that's another story more related to the venue.\nTLDR; The conference content and speakers were great, in addition to the logistics. I missed the workshop day, but everyone told me it was also fantastic (both venue and contents). I learned a lot, not only about Groovy or Grails, but also about GraphQL, Ratpack and concurrence in general.\nLet me summarize some of the talks I attended:\n Make concurrency groovy again, by Alonso Torres (@alotor). Alonso gave an excellent overview of the main available resources regarding concurrence in the Groovy ecosystem, comparing some of them in terms of design, code readability and even performance. Threads, functional style resources, parallel collections, Atomic variables, fork/join, GPars, actors... and even how to steal a bit from others (Clojure, Akka or Spark) thanks to the Java bindings. Take a look at the slides #Greach2017 @alotor a punto de comenzar su charla sobre Concurrencia en @ApacheGroovy pic.twitter.com/u0dnTx5aIp\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) March 31, 2017  Javaslang \u0026amp; Groovy: The best of both worlds, by Iván López (@ilopmar). Another hands-on master class by Iván, combining and comparing some of the benefits of Javaslang with what's available out-of-the-box in Groovy. The demo part (90% of the talk) covered a lot of interesting examples: Optional vs Option, Try, Functional Interfaces, Tuples, Javaslang collections, Pattern matching, validations, ...

Noam gave a complete review of the features included in HTTP Builder NG, the current available implementations and some advanced features and use cases like header parsers, content parsers, request interceptors or request encoders hasMany Considered Harmful, by Burt Beckwith (@BurtBeckwith). Burt gave this talk for the first time in 2010 at the Spring One, pointing out some performance problems when mapping collections with any ORM tool (like GORM or Hibernate). After seven years, he revisited the topic repeating (sadly) the same warnings about more or less the same problems, some of them critical with huge data collections @burtbeckwith talking about \u0026quot;hasMany considered harmful\u0026quot; at @greachconf pic.twitter.com/gJA7f3HW5X\n\u0026mdash; jmiguel (@jmiguel) March 31, 2017  GraphQL development with Groovy, by Mario García (@marioggar). Thanks to Mario now I have a clear view of what GraphQL provides, and specially what it does not provide. He reviewed the main features, the logic behind schemas, types querying, hierarchy, operations, the introspective nature of GraphQL... Mario also demoed some useful combination of GraphQL with tools like GraphiQL or Relay. He even teased GQL, his own DSL library to use GraphQL directly from Groovy. Awesome :-) #Greach and now in @GreachConf we\u0026#39;ll learn about GraphQL and Groovy from the great @marioggar pic.twitter.com/8PoSK7DoOv\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) March 31, 2017  Groovy Puzzlers 4: The Bytecode Bites Back, by El Groovyssimo (@el_groovyssimo) and Noam Tenne (@NoamTenne). Again, this was fantastic. Entertaining and somehow even educational. It's based on the Java Puzzlers created by Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter, but focused on Groovy. Big fan of the format It\u0026#39;s time for #groovypuzzlers! @el_groovyssimo and @NoamTenne rocking on stage at @greachconf! pic.twitter.com/mVjhLJ6fhr\n\u0026mdash; Autentia (@autentia) March 31, 2017  Alexa, Tell Me I’m Groovy, by Ryan Vanderwerf (@RyanVanderwerf). Ryan explained how the Alexa platform works and some basic info about the main SDKs: Alexa Skills Kit and Alexa Voice Service. Ryan also showed how he uses Grails apps to create Alexa services and cards, and how to test them online with Echosim.io. Very interesting, and one of those talks in which the audience leaves with some good ideas for the future Alexa can do GREAT stuff! @RyanVanderwerf has her tell @Greachconf we\u0026#39;re all #Groovy 😎 @amazon #grailsfw @groovypodcast pic.twitter.com/c2KfK0A7u2\n\u0026mdash; Ted Vinke (@tvinke) April 1, 2017  Grails keynote, by Graeme Rocher (@GraemeRocher). The anual Grails keynote in Greach, in which Graeme showed what came with Grails 3.2 (improvements in the awesome JSON views, in profiles, GORM 6, ...) and what will come with Grails 3.3: GORM 6.1 (already available independently), Spring Boot 1.5.x and Hibernate 5.2. Regarding GORM, the main things for the 6.1 version are: Improvements in common AST transforms, common services, and Data Services, package scanning and a better mapping DSL. Graeme showed some of the new features and they looked amazing, very good work :-) What\u0026#39;s new with #grailsfw?@graemerocher delivers keynote @greachconf and fills us in! pic.twitter.com/RJ029GnXGN\n\u0026mdash; Object Computing (@ObjectComputing) April 1, 2017  Geb best practices, by Marcin Erdmann (@MarcinErdmann). Marcin gave us some tips to make a better use of Geb, starting with the reminder that a Module is a Navigator, that Navigators are iterable, and the advantages of overloading some methods, having dynamic base urls or page parametrizations. He also explained how to inject Javascript into pages (if needed). Other best practices: using strongly typed Geb code, tracking the current page type, always keep the at checks simple and quick and that modules are not meant only for reuse but also to isolate complex blocks. #Greach my @greachconf continues with @MarcinErdmann (Geb project lead since 2014) about Geb best practices pic.twitter.com/YCQ3Whor9W\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) April 1, 2017  Mastering Async In Ratpack, by Danny Hyun (@Lspacewalker). Danny went beyond the basic concepts of concurrency in a fantastic code-driven talk, showing a lot of good examples about the complexity of this kind of problems. He explained how Ratpack comes to the rescue, how the Ratpack concept of Promise works, how to manage them and how to test complex concurrent execution flows. Very complete for 45 minutes and very well presented.

Vuelvo a insistir en la comparación con los años anteriores, y mantendré el apartado de análisis y retrospectiva, que quizá sea la parte más interesante.\nY todo, como ya sabéis, gracias a  la manía  mi hábito de registrar en Board Game Geek todas las partidas según las estoy jugando mediante su fantástica (aunque aún mejorable) aplicación para Android.\nEvolución de las partidas jugadas en los últimos años   2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Total desde 2006   Total de partidas jugadas 98 84 81 117 161 952   Juegos diferentes jugados 55 71 52 81 80 356   Juegos con dos o más partidas 15 13 14 19 40 161   Sesiones de Juego 35 30 44 41 36 322    Partidas jugadas por mes hasta 2016   Análisis:  Este 2016 he jugado más que en los dos años anteriores, aunque no tengo esa sensación porque el número de sesiones es parecido (30 en 2015 vs 35 en 2016) En 2016 he probado 25 juegos nuevos, siguen siendo bastantes pero una proporción mucho menor que otros años. Se nota que he repetido mucho a algunos juegos (casi un tercio de las partidas fueron a Pandemic, Pandemic Legacy o Código Secreto). Bastante en línea con las estadísticas globales sobre partidas jugadas que publicó la BGG hace unos días La experiencia con la temporada 1 de Pandemic Legacy está siendo fabulosa. Cada vez juego más a cooperativos y cada vez me atraen más los juegos que permiten cierta repetición y continuación a base de reglas legacy o campañas en general Aparte de lo relativo a juegos de mesa y rol, durante 2016 tengo registradas más de 150h en Steam (de un total de 393.3h). Es altamente improbable que en 2017 pueda mantener esas cifras (de hecho, apenas juego desde el verano pasado) Como dato nuevo en este análisis, mi h-index como jugador ha subido a 11 después de unos años estancado en 10. Dato curioso, aunque poco útil :-P  Retrospectiva:  Si mi tiempo de ocio ya era limitado en 2016... este año que comienza será peor aún. Veremos qué tal lo voy llevando Sigo sin haber podido retomar la campaña que dirigía con El Anillo Único, y tampoco he podido comenzar a dirigir partidas nuevas a Aventuras en la Marca del Este o Baker Street RPG. En 2017 debería intentar hacer algo al respecto Siguiendo la triste dinámica que comencé el año pasado, este año no he jugado apenas a prototipos. Sigo perteneciendo a la Asociación Ludo pero ni pude ir al IV Encuentro de Protos y Tipos ni he podido ir las reuniones con los compañeros de Madrid. Lo hecho mucho de menos pero por desgracia sigue sin ser prioritario ahora mismo :-(  ",

    "body": " Para mantener la buena costumbre (ya, lo sé, no siempre cumplo), voy a relatar brevemente mi experiencia durante Codemotion 2016, uno de los eventos sobre informática y programación más importantes del país. No hay números oficiales definitivos pero en la clausura la organización comentó que hubo más de 2.000 asistentes y más de 150 charlas/talleres. Suelo asistir todos los años, hay otros eventos más potentes e interesantes para tecnologías concretas pero como evento generalista donde puedes ver y oír de todo creo que Codemotion hoy en día no tiene rival (al menos en España).\nTLDR; Después de haber dado dos charlas el año pasado en Codemotion 2015 este año me lo tomé con mucha tranquilidad. Disfruté de muy buenas charlas (otras no tanto, lo normal) y en general me fui con buen sabor de boca. Nota positiva para la organización: hubo menos atascos en los pasillos y menos problemas de aforo en las salas. Nota negativa: sigue sin haber suficiente presencia de mujeres ponentes en el evento y la gestión del tema sigue dejando bastante que desear.\nLeyendo las crónicas de otros asistentes (la de Micael Gallego, por ejemplo) me doy cuenta una vez más de que no hago suficiente networking en estos eventos. Es una pena no aprovechar la ocasión, me crucé con mucha gente conocida: antiguos compañeros, conocidos virtuales, amigos de amigos, etc. Una buena conversación con algunos de ellos bien vale perderse una charla.\nVamos con mi resumen, aprovechando el feedback que he dejado a cada ponente sobre su charla:\n Los androides no sueñan con ovejas eléctricas; sueñan con conciliar, por Susana Morcuende, Yamila Moreno y Jorge Arévalo. Charla muy necesaria, Susana explicó perfectamente en qué consiste la conciliación, y Yamila y Jorge relataron cómo persiguen este objetivo en sus respectivas empresas: Kaleidos y Pronoide. Destaco como ellos que conciliar no es exclusivo de familias con hijos, todos deberíamos estar preocupados en mantener un correcto balance entre la vida laboral y la personal. \u0026quot;Los androides no sueñan con ovejas eléctricas; sueñan con conciliar\u0026quot; #Codemotion2016 pic.twitter.com/TDwxwMI8bk\n\u0026mdash; Womenalia (@womenalia) November 18, 2016  Teletrabajo en el mundo real, por Pablo Alba.

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "  I'll keep my intent to summarize all the important events that I'm attending, and I'll do it again in English as the audience is international. Please, point me any mistake you may find  This last weekend I had the opportunity to attend Greach 2016. Greach is an international conference about the Groovy language and ecosystem, it's hosted here in Madrid but the conference is 100% in English to successfully attract top speakers and attendees. This was the 5th edition of the conference, consolidated as one of the biggest events worldwide about Groovy.\nTLDR; You shouldn't miss this gathering if you have a minimum interest in this technology. Top speakers and high quality content are guaranteed in a confortable and thought provoking environment. Totally worth it.\nEverything was (as expected) brilliantly organized thanks to Iván López (@ilopar), Alberto Vilches (@albertovilches) and a lot of Sponsors. The venue changed from previous years, and Teatros Luchana was also a success. Both auditoriums and networking space had the proper dimensions, very good location, a very handy cafeteria, free wardrobe, more than decent food,... Maybe the sponsors area could have been larger, but everything else was more than correct.\nLet me summarize:\n A Groovy journey in Open Source, by Guillaume Laforge (@glaforge, Apache Groovy Project VP). Guillaume made an interesting overview of Groovy's history, from its birth in 2003 to its current status as a top Open Source programming language inside the Apache Software Foundation, remarking some of the main milestones. The audience particularly appreciated when he explained extensively about the current situation, when no one has the maintenance and evoultion of Groovy as its full-time paid job. My presentation from @greachconf « a Groovy journey in Open Source » https://t.co/gqibxBLdak\n\u0026mdash; Guillaume Laforge — @glaforge@uwyn.net (@glaforge) April 10, 2016  The advantages of Grails, by Søren Berg Glasius (@sbglasius, Grails team member and @GR8Conf organizer). Søren made a nice introduction to Grails, explaining what comes out-of-the-box: GORM, a rich controller layer, GSPs technology, an embedded Tomcat, on-the-fly reloading, Spring DI, i18n, transactional services control, easy taglib generation, Gradle and a useful command line tool. . @sbglasius, about the advantages of Grails FWK, theory and practice #Greach pic.twitter.com/MMmgOhK1e5\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) April 8, 2016  Geb for Browser Automation, by Jacob Aae Mikkelsen (@jacobaae, Software Engineer at Lego and the hands behind the weekly Grails Diary). I received more than I expected, it was a great talk about advanced tips and tricks using Geb for testing automation. Pro tip: extending GebReportingSpec to make captures before and after each test. Slides for my Geb talk: https://t.co/qU8YiSpZp2 code (presentation and application): https://t.co/PNOmj7UQ7b #greach\n\u0026mdash; Jacob Aae Mikkelsen (@JacobAae) April 8, 2016  Groovy Powered Clean Code, by Noam Tenne (@NoamTenne, Backend Engineer at Codefresh). Noam emphasized (as expected) the importance of clean code, focusing on how Groovy itself can improve our codebase: JSON native support, checked exceptions, default imports, AST transformations, extension modules, scripts,... Dynamic GORM, by Burt Beckwith (@BurtBeckwith, Grails core committer and plugin developer). Burt showed a lot of internal features of GORM, and how he is arranging some useful improvements in a promising open source library (which will be published shortly). .@GreachConf continues with @BurtBeckwith and Dynamic GORM. A great speaker will always deliver a great talk #Greach pic.twitter.com/ZbN1FNuspH\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) April 8, 2016  Creating and testing REST contracts with Accurest Gradle Plugin, by Olga Maciaszek-Sharma (@olga_maciaszek, Java and Groovy Developer at Codearte). Olga started with an interesting reflection about the absence of contract compliance in REST, and its importance in microservice-based systems. Do we need to test all after the release of any microservice? Do we test them independently mocking everything else? How will we notice if a contract changes? The last part of her talk was an introduction to Accurest, a Gradle plugin to create REST contracts and to verify its compliance with automatically generated Spock tests. Very promising. Continuous Delivery as Code with Jenkins and Gradle, by Alex Soto (@alexsotob, Software Engineer at CloudBees). Alex started with the principles behind CD: deliver faster, sooner and better. Then he remarked the main idea of agile: Deliver business value more frequently. After that, he metioned some interesting tools like Serenity to make BDD or Gatling for stress testing, and several tips to improve your CD using Gradle and Jenkins. Some jenkins plugins. @alexsotob at #greach pic.twitter.com/69ernpLQhN\n\u0026mdash; jmiguel (@jmiguel) April 8, 2016  Down the RabbitMQ hole, by Alonso Torres (@alotor, Software engineer at Kaleidos). Alonso amazed the audience with a curious proof of concept making a working WebSocket infrastructure using RabbitMQ (thanks to the STOMP protocol), Spring Integration and Groovy. Awesome. #greach you can check the slides of my talk \u0026quot;Down The RabbitMQ Hole\u0026quot; here https://t.co/7UVnOP5tjY I hope you enjoyed it :)\n\u0026mdash; Alonso Torres (@alotor) April 8, 2016  Operating Microservices with Groovy, by Andrés Viedma (@andres_viedma, Software Engineer at Tuenti). Andrés uses Groovy mainly for testing and scripting, and explained some examples of how Groovy makes his day thanks to its dynamic nature. As an example he showed, demo included, how he makes dynamic curl petitions using Groovy's JsonRpcClient. Our friendly troll @andres_viedma talks about testing microservices Using @ApacheGroovy #greach pic.twitter.com/TGGlx7O3Cd\n\u0026mdash; Greach (@greachconf) April 8, 2016  Grails Keynote, by Graeme Rocher (@GraemeRocher, Grails Project Lead). In this interesting keynote Graeme talked about the upcoming Grails 3 and its importance in the future. How Grails has adapted to the current and future needs through diverse and powerful profiles (rest-api, angular, plugin, web-plugin,...). He made an overview of the REST API profile and it looked awesome: No GSP, specific plugins, specific ui plugins, extensible and customizable Json/Markup views,... Brilliant and very useful. Mastering Grails 3 plugins, by Álvaro Sánchez-Mariscal (@alvaro_sanchez, Grails committer at ObjectComputing). Álvaro explained in detail how Grails 3 plugins work, focusing on best practises. He also gave some tips to improve your plugins, with bug emphasis on modularization and tidiness. Gradle Glam: Plugins Galore, by Andrés Almiray (@aalmiray, Griffon project lead, Basilisk project lead, Java Champion). Andrés gave a complete review, live demo included, of several plugins for Gradle. I will highlight some of them: versions (to manage dependencies), license (to update license headers and even download the license docs), versioning (to add the git hash to the project manifest), coveralls (produces an awesome report on coverage) and another to publish generated docs (with ascii doctor, for example) automatically to gh-pages in Github. Creating ASTT’s the painful truth?, by Mario García (@marioggar, Software Engineer at Kaleidos). Mario dared to talk about AST Transformations, giving an extraordinary explanation of the theory behind them, showing a lot of code and sharing several good \u0026amp; bad experiences with them. He explained when and why its a good idea to apply ASTTs, some improvement tips and even tricks to reduce your AST code using ASTTs or combining them. Impressive as usual. Logró conseguido por @marioggar : dar una charla sobre un tema con el Dios de ese tema entre los asistentes :) pic.twitter.com/DjtorAdDqS\n\u0026mdash; Jerónimo López (@jerolba) April 9, 2016  Make your Asciidoctor Groovy, by Stephan Classen (Software Engineer at Canoo). Stephan explained Asciidoctor's screenshot extension, and how easy it may be used with Geb to improve your documentation updating automatically every capture in your manuals after each build. Stephan also explained how the conversion process of AsciiDoctor works, in order to hack any step to adapt the resulting document. Very useful info :-) Groovy Puzzlers S03 – The Unstoppable Puzzlers Hit Again!, by Noam Tenne (@NoamTenne) and  Andrés Almiray El Groovyssimo (@el_groovyssimo). I loved this contest, entertainment at its finest and very very educational. It's based on the mythic Java Puzzlers tradition created by Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter, but migrated to Groovy mainly by JBaruch. Some intriguing blocks of Groovy code are shown and the audience needs to choose between 4 possible outputs. Obviously it's easy to miss, but hard not to laugh and learn afterwards. Hilarious. Having so much fun trying to solve the #groovypuzzlers at the @greachconf pic.twitter.com/oujCaepcHA\n\u0026mdash; Andrés Viedma (@andres_viedma) April 9, 2016   See you in Greach 2017!!\n",

I should have written this weeks ago but better late than ever, right?\n FOSDEM 2016   You can read about the rest of my FOSDEM here:\nFOSDEM 2016: Friday FOSDEM 2016: Saturday  As a retrospective, I attended a lot of talks and almost all of them were very interesting, but looking back now I realize that I should've spent more time in the stands and aisles. I expected to do networking when forced by room capacity issues, but luckily we never suffered this problem despite attending some overcrowded talks (with a lot of people having to stay outside). Perhaps it wasn't so bad, because even so I spent a lot of money on textile products :-D\nOur FOSDEM Sunday ended being much like the day before. A large majority of the talks I attended were in the Legal and Policy Issues track.\nLet me summarize:\nBuilding a geo-aware Operating System, by Zeeshan Ali (@zeenix, Gnome developer, Red Hat). I was very thrilled with this talk, but it didn't meet my expectations. Zeeshan (and others) have developed great tools for the Gnome desktop: geoclue, geocode-glib and the integration with GNOME Maps seemed great, but I expected some less obvious features (from the functional point of view, of course) than locating yourself on a map. Having said that, geo-awareness in mobile devices was a total revolution, and I'm sure sooner or later it'll also be strongly reflected in our desktops #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Building a geo-aware OS\u0026#39; by Zeeshan Alí.

Being a member of the OpenStreetMap Foundation and an addicted mapper, I felt the need to attend this talk. It ended up being an enumeration of projects, without the necessary detail to make the explanation amusing or interesting. At least I recognize that they talked about GSoC with great enthusiasm, made me want to participate at some point #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Results of Google Summer of Code 2015 at OSGeo\u0026#39; by Margherita di Leo and Anne Ghisla pic.twitter.com/q9mr5bxuim\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016  Open source foundations: threat or menace?, by Richard Fontana (@richardfontana, IP, Open Source and Patent lawyer at Red Hat). Mr Fontana gave us a very interesting and thought provoking talk. After a brief explanation about legal differences between 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(6) foundation types in the US (and why some Open Source foundations have chosen one or the other), he detailed his concerns about the work carried out by some foundations:  Sometimes foundations drive to an illusion of property We have seen examples of foundations \"artificially\" prolonging the life of a project, which is not always positive Some Open Source projects receive legal support by foundations and liability protection, but he explained that it should only apply if the foundation is in charge of what the project (or volunteer) does. Sometimes foundations (like Apache Software Foundation or Eclipse Foundation) presume of the independence of their projects, and this is a contradiction Foundations serving only as right holders in trademark issues In some foundations there is not a clear barrier between business management and technical management, as it should be Sometimes, the amount of power inside a foundation is derived by the amount of money donated (in cash or man hours), this gives the message that the project from those foundations are for sale  #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Open source foundations: threat or menace?\u0026#39; by Richard Fontana of @RedHatEMEA pic.twitter.com/ATMxrZ6If0\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016  JEP 243: Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface and what it can be used for, by Christian Thalinger (@christhalinger, Member of the HotSpot compiler team, Oracle).

Foster (@miahfost). Back in the Legal DevRoom, Jeremiah gave us a very interesting talk starting with a lot of information about safety-critical software and why it is important that software freedom becomes more present in this context. He also discussed it may be even possible to certify GNU/Linux at a safety-critical level, and how copyleft should be mandatory given that it provides more transparency not only in the code itself but also in the entire development process. In GPLv3 licensed projects he explained some concerns about how the install info may require disclosure of the encryption keys used to sign a boot image. Another concern in the industry is that end users should not be able to modify embedded software in safety-critical systems. #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Status of safety-critical FOSS\u0026#39; by Jeremiah C.

Sumana gave a very well argued speech without media support, leaving clues of a probable theatrical past (or present). The basic comparison was that, just like the GPL restricts some developer's freedom (about redistributing under an incompatible license) to protect all users' freedom to use, inspect or modify the code, in the same way Codes of Conduct restrict some people's behaviour to increase everyone's freedom. I share Sumana's point of view, also when she said that (I quote): we will make better software and have a greater impact if more people, and more different kinds of people, find our communities more appealing to work with #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Comparing codes of conduct to copyleft licenses\u0026#39; by Sumana Harihareshwara pic.twitter.com/izDKac63Fi\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016  Who's afraid of the DCO and why you should help adopt the DCO for your project, by James Bottomley (@jejb_, Linux kernel SCSI subsystem Maintainer, Odin CTO). Another brilliant talk, with the added bonus that James used Impress.js :-D James presented DCO as an alternative to the popular CLAs. He explained why your project needs a contributor agreement in the first place, why Linux adopted the DCO ten years ago, and a lot of info about best practices and possible problems #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Who\u0026#39;s afraid of the DCO and why you should help adopt the DCO for your project\u0026#39; by James Bottomley pic.twitter.com/YVYSbCcUnU\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016  Pick a peck of license pickers, An in-depth look at efforts to make choosing a license easy, by John Sullivan (@johns_fsf, Executive Director of the Free Software Foundation). John did an interesting analysis of the current options to choose a software license, beginning with the claim that something has to be done because there are still a lot of projects without license but in a clever way to reduce the license proliferation. There are some guides (like the one the FSF itself has) which represent a significant barrier for most users. A lot of text with sometimes hard to understand differences between options. Apart from this approach, there are some popular tools like choosealicense.com from Github or the Creative Commons' license chooser, but they also present several problems. The options order is important, the descriptions may be misleading, summaries are not fair... The QA turn was also brilliant, given that Brandon Keepers (Open Source Lead in Github) was there to argue their position. #FOSDEM \u0026#39;An in-depth look at efforts to make choosing a license easy\u0026#39; by John Sullivan, executive Director of @fsf pic.twitter.com/miXSGgynhe\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016  Putting 8 Million People on the Map: Revolutionizing crisis response through open mapping tools, by Blake Girardot (@BlakeGirardot, Vice President of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team). The Janson auditorium (with a capacity of 1415 people) was packed full for this closing keynote. Mr Girardot explained perfectly how open source tools have allowed a lot of contributors (including me!) to improve in a radical way our disaster preparedness as a global society. One of the recent examples: After the Nepal Earthquake in 2015, about 700 contributors using open source tools such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's Tasking Manager made more than 13 million edits to OpenStreetMap in the first two weeks after the earthquake. Impressive, isn't it? He also described other tools and projects like the OpenStreetMap Export Tool or the OpenAerialMap project, but as an active member of the OpenStreetMap group, I'll expand the information about this in future posts #FOSDEM almost ending with \u0026#39;Putting 8 Million People on the Map\u0026#39; by Blake Girardot about @openstreetmap and @hotosm pic.twitter.com/SdB1Z3QIJe\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 31, 2016   See you in Brussels for FOSDEM 2017!!\n",

I attended a couple of talks in the Free Java DevRoom, another couple about Open Source Design but surprisingly most of them were in the Legal and Policy Issues track.\nThis doesn't mean that this is what matters most to me now (and it matters, a lot), but surely there are other events to listen about containers, virtualisation, Java or Python. IMO, there's no better place than FOSDEM's Legal DevRoom to feel the pulse of the FOSS community.\nLet me summarize:\nThe State of OpenJDK, by Mark Reinhold (@mreinhold, Chief Architect of the Java Platform, Oracle). The annual review by Mr. Reinholm here in FOSDEM. Main ideas:\n OpenJDK is growing with a lot of new projects (and not only commanded by Oracle) 9 main projects and more than 72 JEPs (in that moment) targeting JDK9, including JavaDoc.Next, search capability in Javadocs (powered by Javascript) Mark gave interesting tips about Valhalla Project, that may enable Java to have Classes without instances He also highlighted Panama Project, an improvement in the JNI to enrich connections between the Java VM and non-java APIs (mostly for C/C++)  arrancamos @fosdem con @mreinhold y un repaso al estado actual de #OpenJDK #Fosdem pic.twitter.com/zY8Z3LCJyj\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 30, 2016  This Is Not A Drill - Preparing for JDK 9, by Dalibor Topić (@robilad, OpenJDK Product Manager, Oracle) and Rory O’Donnell (OpenJDK Quality Manager, Oracle). A compilation of accumulated wisdom obtained by projects testing JDK9 early access builds. We already knew that, for the first time, JDK9 will not be fully backwards compatible so some tips about how to prepare your projects for JDK 9 were necessary. If you lead a Java project, you need to pay special attention to JEP 260 (internal APIs will be inaccesible), JEP 162 (removal of some deprecated methods), JEP 220 (changes in the binary structure of JRE and JDK), JEP 261 (the new module system) and JEP 223 (new version-string scheme) Now listening to \u0026quot;This is not a drill - Preparing for JDK 9\u0026quot; #FOSDEM pic.twitter.com/RU9km0p6t5\n\u0026mdash; Esther Lozano (@esloho) January 30, 2016  Designing accessible applications, by Samuel Thibault (computer science assistant professor). Yet another talk about accessibility, I've attended a lot of them and sadly they tend to be the same talk again and again. An interesting thought was that the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that if you (as a developer/company) don't make reasonable accommodations for disabled people, you are discriminating them #FOSDEM Designing accessible applications (instead of having to make them accessible) by Samuel Thibault pic.twitter.com/D9c5ZDLFUE\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 30, 2016  Blender as virtual studio lighting playground, by Tuomas Kuosmanen (@tigert, GIMP developer and artist). I attended this talk mostly to meet @tigert but also to see the actual status of Blender (I played with it for a while centuries ago). The talk was amusing but not very advanced, Tuomas told us about a POC he made to recreate a photography studio lightning set-up with blender #FOSDEM Blender as virtual studio lighting playground, by T. Kuosmanen pic.twitter.com/yEuhUNPvzV\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 30, 2016  Copyleft For the Next Decade, by Bradley M. Kuhn (President at Software Freedom Conservancy and on the Board of Directors of the Free Software Foundation). Perhaps my favourite talk of the day, Bradley is a great expert about Open Source and maybe the main Copyleft enforcer nowadays. He gave some tips to pursue software freedom, and how all of this is in danger if license violations are note enforced. Sadly, he said, given any open source project there's almost always a proprietary version forked from it. A famous example is Apple when they forked BSD. I leave you with an important thought: If Copyleft is not enforced, is there any difference? #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Copyleft for the next decade\u0026#39; by Bradley M. Kuhn pic.twitter.com/UTPAYB0oO6\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 30, 2016  Who controls your project? Governance in the real world, by Jesús M. Gonzalez-Barahona (@jgbarah, URJC professor and Bitergia co-founder). Jesús gave a very complete talk about metrics related to governance, and using Bitergia's tools he showed how it's possible to know interesting things about a project like:\n Who contributes? Not only individually, sometimes you want to know how they are affiliated How are the changes been reviewed? How are they fixing the tickets? Are we neutral? A project's Pony Factor: the lowest number of committers whose total contribution constitutes the majority of the codebase A project's Elephant Factor: just as the Pony Factor, but with companies Geographical diversity, gender diversity, ...   Full room at \u0026quot;Who controls your project?\u0026quot; @jgbarah talk!! Open Development Metrics for governance analysis #fosdem pic.twitter.com/Fd70nrqZey\n\u0026mdash; Bitergia (@Bitergia) January 30, 2016  TL;DR on legal strategy for commercial ventures, by James Shubin (@purpleidea, Engineer at Red Hat). James gave the audience a lot of recommendations on choosing a software license. He also explained how a lot of people mix up the concepts of proprietary license and commercial license. He remarked that Copyleft is also the best solution for any employer, because it protects them from a developer/s leaving the company and forking the project. He gave some other examples about how Copyleft has a lot of synergies with profit. Loved first prediction by @purpleidea :) We are taking AGPLv3 seriously here! #FOSDEM2016 pic.twitter.com/tYkHJ7eAWm\n\u0026mdash; Taiga.io (@taigaio) January 30, 2016  Open Source is being ruined and it’s all our fault, by Brian Harrington (@brianredbeard). In the same line of the previous talk, RedBeard explained the good vs the bad ways to profit in Open Source. The good ones are mainly (no surprise here): Selling a \"boxed\" product, selling support or selling subscriptions #FOSDEM \u0026#39;Open Source is being ruined and it’s all our fault\u0026#39; by @brianredbeard pic.twitter.com/yNNVPXzBlZ\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 30, 2016   You can read about the rest of my FOSDEM here:\nFOSDEM 2016: Friday FOSDEM 2016: Sunday  ",

    "body": " Disclaimer: I attended FOSDEM in Brussels last January. I should have written this weeks ago but better late than ever, right?\n FOSDEM 2016   As you may know if you are reading this, FOSDEM is a not to be missed event about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). By far, it is the most important gathering about FOSS in the planet. It's an unbeatable opportunity to attend great talks and workshops, but also to hang around with amazing people and top professionals.\nThe most impressive fact is that FOSDEM is organized by volunteers and everything is community driven, from each year tracks to their schedule. It's free to attend and there is no registration. You just need to show up :-)\nThis year, the usual huge numbers even increased (source: fosdem.org):\n 2 days more than 8,000 attendees 52 tracks in 28 different rooms 569 speakers 618 events (talks, workshops, panels, ...)  Apart from the main event during the weekend and the official Friday Beer Event (the mythic Delirium Café overcrowded with hackers from around the world), each year there are dozens Fringe events around FOSDEM during the previous days, totally independent but also related to FOSS and communities.\nI had the opportunity to give a lightning talk in one of those fringe events: the Floss Community Metrics Meeting (FCM2). Let me bring here their own description:\n This meeting is intended to be an open venue for community managers, DevRel managers, and FLOSS community experts to present ideas, tools, and analysis that the FLOSS community is already doing with FLOSS platforms. It is open to discuss about collaboration, synergies, etc. It will be organized to foster discussion, but will also focus on development of new tools, improvement of existing ones, and how to spread the knowledge about what is being done and can be done in this area  My talk was about measuring health and ethics in programming languages, a brief version focusing on the metrics aspects of my talk in the last Codemotion event about Governance in programming languages.\nTime for @luiyo \u0026#39;s lightning talk at @flossmetrics about measuring health and ethics of programming languages :D pic.twitter.com/tEBhbLZed7\n\u0026mdash; Esther Lozano (@esloho) January 29, 2016  Let me summarize some of the other talks:\nDuane O'Brien (PayPal) talked about measuring velocity from the InnerSource point of view Sumana Harihareswara (Changeset Consulting) explained some of the usual mistakes measuring FOSS projects. I loved (and will use!) her explanation of the lamppost fallacy John Sullivan (Executive Director @ FSF) started explaining the FSF's mission (\"all computer users must be able to do everything they need to do on any computer using only free software\") and then how they use free software project metrics (even in non-software initiatives) to see if they progress towards their goal #FCM2 John Sullivan, Executive Director of the @fsf, speaking about \u0026quot;containerizing\u0026quot; non-software initiatives pic.twitter.com/nTT1Yy2cQk\n\u0026mdash; Luis GC (@luiyo) January 29, 2016  Ioana Chiorean (Mozilla Rep Mentor) told us about Mozilla's representatives program, how they work and how they measure their progress J. M. González-Barahona (Bitergia) showed us GrimoireLab, an impressive open source tool by Bitergia using (among other things) Perceval, Elastic Search, Python and Kibana Donnie Berkholz (451 Research) about another common mistake, comparing communities and projects that shouldn't be compared between them (OS vs editors vs frameworks vs ...) Dawn Foster (Univ. of Greenwich) showed us Gource, an impressive tool to visualize repos. I knew about it some years ago and it still has no rival in awesomeness, just look at this demo Jos Poortvliet (ownCloud) explained how they analyse their metrics: code commiters, ticket participants, discussion participants and so on Lauri Apple (Zalando) surprised me with Zalando's numbers: 17 million customers, +10,000 employees (+1,000 technologist) and more than 300 open source projects. Not so bad for an online fashion platform... She showed us Catwatch, their own open-source projects dashboard Jose Manrique Lopez (Bitergia) showed us the evolution of Cauldron, another fantastic tool from Bitergia to display the metrics behind Github repositories JJ Merelo (Univ. of Granada) described his problems with his own tool to rank Spanish users and repositories from Github Christoph Wickert (Fedora Project) showed us HyperKitty, a django-based tool to replace Pipermail as the default archiver for Mailman. Looked like a gigantic step ahead of its predecessor Kristof Van Tomme (Provonix) explained how they started with a tool to generate upgrade reports from Drupal sites in order to review the upgrade status of the site's modules, and ended with a daemon analyzing thousands of Drupal sites to get not only update reports, but lists of sites using a certain module, comparing modules and the demographic of their adoption and son on  TL;DR: it was worth it attending the event, totally, and not only because I was in the speaker roster (with excellent companions).\nYou can read about the rest of my FOSDEM here:\nFOSDEM 2016: Saturday FOSDEM 2016: Sunday  ",

Salvo el Mus, ninguno supera las 2-3 partidas. Es lógico considerando que las 84 partidas jugadas han sido a 71 juegos diferentes.\n Partidas jugadas por mes hasta 2015   Análisis:  Este 2015 he jugado más o menos tanto como en 2014, aunque sigue siendo bastante menos que hace unos años. Es interesante ver que en proporción más de la mitad de mis partidas son en las convenciones a las que asisto cada año (Jornadas TdN, Zona Lúdica, ...) En las pasadas TdN más o menos la mitad del tiempo lo dediqué a rol cuando hasta hace un par de años era 100% juegos de mesa. En los números crudos eso cuenta como una única partida aunque ocupa toda una mañana o tarde Aunque no han descendido las partidas respecto al año pasado, sí lo han hecho considerablemente las sesiones (44 en 2014 vs 30 en 2015) Se vuelve a notar que me encanta probar cosas nuevas. En 2015 he probado 43 juegos nuevos, que son bastantes para los 71 juegos diferentes que he jugado. Eso supone partidas más largas y por tanto menos partidas por sesión Por desgracia este año he jugado a muy pocos prototipos. Sigo perteneciendo a la Asociación Ludo pero no pude ir al IV Encuentro de Protos y Tipos y cada vez me resulta más complicado asistir a las reuniones en Madrid No aparece en estos datos, pero otro que ha venido para quedarse es Steam. En 2015 tengo registradas más de 150h en esta plataforma... y en 2016 irá a más  Retrospectiva:  Mi tiempo de ocio cada vez es más limitado, y no hablemos del tiempo de ocio con amigos alrededor de una mesa. En 2016 tengo que aprovechar estos tiempos mejor Mantengo uno de los propósitos que hice el año pasado: en 2016 intentaré jugar más al tipo de juegos que me suele encajar y menos a los que me dan bastante igual En todo 2015 no he podido convocar ni una sola sesión de la campaña que dirigía (hace ya ni se sabe) con El Anillo Único. Sigo queriendo retomarlo, veremos cómo lo hago para encajarlo en mi 2016 (y veremos que opinan los sufridos jugadores, igual alguno necesita un relevo) Siguiendo con el rol, la intención es jugar cada vez más y probar cuantos más juegos nuevos mejor, pero trataré de encontrar continuidad con alguno. Ya veremos si es El Anillo Único, Aventuras en la Marca del Este, Baker Street RPG, ...  ",

Creemos que el tema es muy interesante y estamos seguros de que os gustará. El ponente ya ha pasado por nuestro Pub y no hemos podido resistirnos a traerle de vuelta. Por la acumulación de eventos deportivos y sociales hemos tenido que poner la charla un viernes, concretamente el próximo viernes 12 de Junio. Esperamos que puedan asistir igualmente, y para facilitarlo hemos retrasado el inicio de la charla hasta las 20:30.\nJosé Manuel López Nicolás (@ScientiaJMLN) es Profesor Titular en el Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular de la Universidad de Murcia, además de un divulgador científico de referencia. Es socio de ARP-SAPC, de Círculo Escéptico y es responsable del blog Scientia y con él ha ganado (entre otros) un Premio Bitácoras en 2013 al mejor blog de Ciencia, otro Mejor blog de Ciencia en 2013 según 20 Blogs, un Premio ASEBIO a la divulgación de biotecnología, un premio Tesla y Premio Web 2015 de La Verdad. En 2014 consiguió además una importante Mención Honorífica en los Premios Prismas a la divulgación.\nLa charla se titulará «La cosmética y sus 7 mentiras» y el propio ponente nos la resume:\n A lo largo de la conferencia se desvelarán cuáles son los principales trucos empleados por la industria de los productos cosméticos para aumentar su cuota de ventas. Mediante diversos ejemplos correspondientes a cosméticos muy conocidos se mostrará que la ciencia se emplea impunemente como arma para confundir y engañar al consumidor. Además, se señalarán los culpables del caos que rodea al mundo del marketing pseudocientífico en el campo no sólo de la cosmética sino también en el de la alimentación. Por último, se proporcionarán posibles soluciones a las 7 grandes mentiras que rodean al sector de los productos de belleza… y que serán descubiertas a lo largo de la charla.

Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome y Paul Kurtz a la cabeza, y 25 años de la versión española, respaldada por más de 250. Esa versión española la impulsaron los astrofísicos Miguel Ángel Sabadell (@cienciadetuvida) y Javier Armentia (@javierarmentia), y el 9 de mayo tendremos a ambos en nuestro EeeP. Recordarán el manifiesto, las circunstancias en que se publicó y nos hablarán de si la sociedad actual sigue aceptando la astrología como si fuera algo serio, incluso científico, o si ha cambiado algo en este tiempo.\nY a continuación daremos la palabra a los asistentes para que todo el que quiera cuente si alguna vez se tomó en serio la astrología (incluso si sigue haciéndolo), si fue un buscador de ovnis, si acudía a que le leyeran las cartas, si se formó como experto en reiki… Ya sabemos que cualquier escéptico puede tener un pasado crédulo.

Es también autor del blog Sonicando, colabora en diversos medios y hace unos meses publicó su primera novela de ficción: Impostores.\nEl propio ponente nos describe su charla:\n En los últimos años, varias epidemias de nuevos virus emergentes han puesto en jaque la salud de millones de personas alrededor del mundo. Solo basta con ver las cifras de la gran pandemia de VIH o de la reciente epidemia de Ebola para hacernos buena idea del riesgo que representan. Sin embargo, muchas de estas epidemias desatan grandes polémicas debido al papel central que juega la industria farmacéutica y sus relaciones con organizaciones gubernamentales para luchar contra estos peligrosos virus.

Esta vez no han descendido las sesiones (44 en 2014 vs 41 en 2013) pero han sido generalmente más cortas y principalmente para juegos largos (9 de ellas para jugar al rol). En 2014 he probado 35 juegos nuevos, que son bastantes para los 52 juegos diferentes que he jugado. Eso supone aprender, probar, experimentar... pero conlleva menos partidas por sesión. Si analizamos la distribución por meses vemos que sólo se mantiene el pico de Agosto por las Jornadas TdN. Este año por desgracia no he podido ir a más jornadas. Cada vez juego más y más a prototipos... aunque desde hace unos meses ya no pertenezco a la Junta de Asociación Ludo sigo estando implicado.  Retrospectiva:  El rol ha vuelto para quedarse. Jugué bastante, principalmente antes del verano, y creo que en 2015 jugaré más aún. Inicié como master una campaña de rol con El Anillo Único, tras varios meses con buena regularidad el parón veraniego ha durado hasta hoy. La responsabilidad es mía al ser el organizador, no puede volver a suceder cuando arranque otras campañas. Respecto a los juegos de mesa, en 2015 intentaré jugar más a los juegos que me encantan y menos a los que me dan bastante igual. Al hilo del punto anterior, este año más que nunca he vendido todos los juegos que no me encantan. Acumular por acumular es ETA (y el espacio que tengo para juegos es limitado). El tiempo pasa volando... y en mi caso el tiempo libre cada vez está más limitado. Hay que priorizar y seleccionar muy bien (cualquiera diría que sigo hablando de un hobby).  ",

Para ello, el Sábado 10 de Enero de 2015 nos visitan David Cabo y Eva Belmonte con una charla titulada Periodismo para gente incrédula. David y Eva son, respectivamente, director y responsable de proyectos de la Fundación Civio ( @civio), una organización sin ánimo de lucro que promueve la transparencia y el acceso a la información pública a través de la tecnología y el periodismo. Él es programador y ella periodista, y aplican cada día ese axioma en proyectos como El Indultómetro, ¿Dónde van mis impuestos?, El BOE nuestro de cada día o Quién Manda. En ellos tratan de aunar el pensamiento crítico y el método periodístico para proporcionar una información diferente, basada prácticas más propias de otras disciplinas de investigación social y científica: uso de fuentes primarias y públicas, apertura de datos en bruto para su verificación por terceros, análisis y cruzado con técnicas informáticas y transparencia metodológica. Juntos tratan de extender estas prácticas impartiendo formación a periodistas en investigación y visualización de datos. Antes de fundar Civio, David Cabo ( @dcabo) fue uno de los organizadores del Desafío AbreDatos, promovió la iniciativa #adoptaundiputado para facilitar el acceso a las declaraciones de bienes de los parlamentarios españoles, y creó el portal de transparencia europeo AsktheEU.org. También ha colaborado con periodistas en la extracción y análisis de datos públicos para la investigación ‘ Looting the Seas’, del Internacional Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Es ingeniero superior en Informática y licenciado en Psicología. Ha trabajado como consultor, desarrollador y arquitecto de software durante doce años en proyectos para British Telecom, Accenture, Ericsson o BBVA Global Markets. Eva Belmonte ( @evabelmonte) es periodista, responsable de proyectos en Civio y autora del blog El BOE nuestro de cada día, donde intenta traducir y contextualizar las decisiones más relevantes que se publican en el boletín. Dirige el trabajo periodístico en iniciativas de Civio como El Indultómetro y Quién Manda. Entre 2005 y 2012 trabajó en el diario El Mundo, y colabora regularmente en otros medios como La Marea.

No contiene spoilers, pero sí da una buena idea del ambiente que se respira en la novela, el tono de este tomo me ha parecido especialmente pesimista y desolador (que ya es decir para Canción de Hielo y Fuego).\nCrow-Black (and white) by Hamish Irvine, from Flickr — CC BY-NC   Back on the road, the septon said, “We would do well to keep a watch tonight, my friends. The villagers say they’ve seen three broken men skulking round the dunes, west of the old watchtower.” “Only three?” Ser Hyle smiled. “Three is honey to our swordswench. They’re not like to trouble armed men.” “Unless they’re starving,” the septon said. “There is food in these marshes, but only for those with the eyes to find it, and these men are strangers here, survivors from some battle. If they should accost us, ser, I beg you, leave them to me.” “What will you do with them?” “Feed them. Ask them to confess their sins, so that I might forgive them. Invite them to come with us to the Quiet Isle.” “That’s as good as inviting them to slit our throats as we sleep,” Hyle Hunt replied. “Lord Randyll has better ways to deal with broken men—steel and hempen rope.” “Ser? My lady?” said Podrick. “Is a broken man an outlaw?” “More or less,” Brienne answered. Septon Meribald disagreed. “More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They’ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know. “Then they get a taste of battle. “For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they’ve been gutted by an axe. “They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they’re fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they’re fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world... “And the man breaks. “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them. but he should pity them as well.”  ",

En parte por un gran descenso en las sesiones (¿dónde quedaron los Viernes Ludopáticos?) y en parte porque cada vez juego menos a juegos ligeros y los juegos algo más interesantes/intensos tienden a ser más largos. Curiosamente, la cifra de juegos diferentes es equivalente a la de años anteriores. Me encanta probar juegos nuevos y eso se nota. Si analizamos la distribución por meses vemos que sigue siendo bastante equivalente, destacando como siempre Agosto por las Jornadas TdN y en 2013 también destaca Mayo por Zona Lúdica. El descenso de partidas de 2013 se observa perfectamente en casi todos los meses. Es asombrosa la diferencia de 2012 a 2013 en Agosto y Diciembre. Cada vez hay más prototipos... ¡aunque varios de ellos ya han sido publicados!  Propósito para 2014 Jugar más, jugar mejor... pero sobre todo volver a dedicarle tiempo al rol.

    "body": " \n ( Mediante la difusión de este manifiesto me adhiero a la iniciativa #NoSinEvidencia. Podéis seguir la actividad de la campaña en el hashtag de Twitter #NoSinEvidencia)  \nLogo de la iniciativa #NoSinEvidencia (fuente)     MANIFIESTO  La evidencia científica es uno de los pilares sobre los que se asienta la medicina moderna. Esto no siempre ha sido así: durante años, se aplicaron tratamientos médicos sin comprobar previamente su eficacia y seguridad. Algunos fueron efectivos, aunque muchos tuvieron resultados desastrosos. Sin embargo, en la época en la que más conocimientos científicos se acumulan de la historia de la humanidad, existen todavía pseudo-ciencias que pretenden, sin demostrar ninguna efectividad ni seguridad, pasar por disciplinas cercanas a la medicina y llegar a los pacientes. Los firmantes de este manifiesto, profesionales sanitarios y de otras ramas de la ciencia, periodistas y otros, somos conscientes de que nuestra responsabilidad, tanto legal como ética, consiste en aportar el mejor tratamiento posible a los pacientes y velar por su salud. Por ello, la aparición en los medios de comunicación de noticias sobre la apertura de un proceso de regulación y aprobación de medicamentos homeopáticos nos preocupa como sanitarios, científicos y ciudadanos, y creemos que debemos actuar al respecto. Las declaraciones de la directora de la Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) asegurando que “no todos los medicamentos homeopáticos tienen que demostrar su eficacia” y que “la seguridad no se tiene que demostrar con ensayos clínicos específicos” no hacen sino aumentar nuestra preocupación. Por lo tanto, solicitamos:  Que no se apruebe ningún tratamiento que no haya demostrado, mediante ensayos clínicos reproducibles, unas condiciones de eficacia y seguridad al menos superiores a placebo. La regulación de unos supuestos medicamentos homeopáticos sin indicación terapéutica es una grave contradicción en sí misma y debe ser rechazada. Si no está indicado para nada ¿para qué hay que darlo?. Que la AEMPS retire de la comercialización aquellos fármacos, de cualquier tipo, que pese a haber sido aprobados, no hayan demostrado una eficacia mayor que el placebo o que presenten unos efectos adversos desproporcionados. Que el Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad y el resto de autoridades sanitarias persigan a aquellas empresas que atribuyen cualidades curativas o beneficiosas para la salud a sus productos sin haberlo demostrado científicamente. Que el Consejo General de Colegios de Médicos de España / Organización Médica Colegial, en cumplimiento del artículo 26 del Código de Deontología Médica, desapruebe a los facultativos que prescriban tratamientos sin evidencia científica demostrada.   Las negritas y los enlaces son míos. También podéis leer el manifiesto en galego, català y euskera.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Apenas dispongo de tiempo para preparar (en condiciones) reseñas, pero no quiero dejar la costumbre de poner pequeños pasajes con la esperanza de conseguir atrapar nuevos lectores.\nBastaría decir que The Demon-Haunted World (El Mundo y sus Demonios en castellano) pasa por ser una de las obras de divulgación más influyentes de uno de los autores más influyentes. Carl Sagan publicó esta obra con más de 60 años (falleció un año más tarde, en 1996), tras una vida dedicada a divulgar e investigar al más alto nivel. Parece que quiso despedirse con un gran compendio de ejemplos, herramientas y consejos, condensados para mostrar las bases del método científico y los fundamentos del pensamiento crítico.\nUno de los ejemplos más conocidos es el que incluyo a continuación, en su insuperable versión original. Unas pocas líneas sirven de abrumadora crítica para un buen conjunto de pseudociencias y religiones:\n\"A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage\" Suppose (I'm following a group therapy approach by the psychologist Richard Franklin) I seriously make such an assertion to you. Surely you'd want to check it out, see for yourself. There have been innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence. What an opportunity! The Demon-Haunted World por Carl Sagan — Wikipedia   \"Show me,\" you say. I lead you to my garage. You look inside and see a ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle--but no dragon. \"Where's the dragon?\" you ask. \"Oh, she's right here,\" I reply, waving vaguely. \"I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon.\" You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints. \"Good idea,\" I say, \"but this dragon floates in the air.\" Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire. \"Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.\" You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible. \"Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick.\" And so on. I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work. Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true. Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder. What I'm asking you to do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so. The only thing you've really learned from my insistence that there's a dragon in my garage is that something funny is going on inside my head. You'd wonder, if no physical tests apply, what convinced me. The possibility that it was a dream or a hallucination would certainly enter your mind. But then, why am I taking it so seriously? Maybe I need help. At the least, maybe I've seriously underestimated human fallibility. Imagine that, despite none of the tests being successful, you wish to be scrupulously open-minded. So you don't outright reject the notion that there's a fire-breathing dragon in my garage. You merely put it on hold. Present evidence is strongly against it, but if a new body of data emerge you're prepared to examine it and see if it convinces you. Surely it's unfair of me to be offended at not being believed; or to criticize you for being stodgy and unimaginative-- merely because you rendered the Scottish verdict of \"not proved.\" Imagine that things had gone otherwise. The dragon is invisible, all right, but footprints are being made in the flour as you watch. Your infrared detector reads off-scale. The spray paint reveals a jagged crest bobbing in the air before you. No matter how skeptical you might have been about the existence of dragons--to say nothing about invisible ones--you must now acknowledge that there's something here, and that in a preliminary way it's consistent with an invisible, fire-breathing dragon. Now another scenario: Suppose it's not just me. Suppose that several people of your acquaintance, including people who you're pretty sure don't know each other, all tell you that they have dragons in their garages--but in every case the evidence is maddeningly elusive. All of us admit we're disturbed at being gripped by so odd a conviction so ill-supported by the physical evidence. None of us is a lunatic. We speculate about what it would mean if invisible dragons were really hiding out in garages all over the world, with us humans just catching on. I'd rather it not be true, I tell you. But maybe all those ancient European and Chinese myths about dragons weren't myths at all. Gratifyingly, some dragon-size footprints in the flour are now reported. But they're never made when a skeptic is looking. An alternative explanation presents itself. On close examination it seems clear that the footprints could have been faked. Another dragon enthusiast shows up with a burnt finger and attributes it to a rare physical manifestation of the dragon's fiery breath. But again, other possibilities exist. We understand that there are other ways to burn fingers besides the breath of invisible dragons. Such \"evidence\"--no matter how important the dragon advocates consider it--is far from compelling. Once again, the only sensible approach is tentatively to reject the dragon hypothesis, to be open to future physical data, and to wonder what the cause might be that so many apparently sane and sober people share the same strange delusion.

    "body": " Este próximo sábado vuelve Escépticos en el Pub Madrid y en esta ocasión repetimos ponente. Tras arrancar la temporada hace una semana con Eparquio Delgado (@eparquiodelgado), esta vez contamos con otro psicólogo totalmente diferente: Vuelve Ramón Nogueras, que ya dejó buen sabor de boca entre el público en Junio de 2011, su primera aparición en EeeP.\nRamón es Licenciado en Psicología por la Universidad de Granada, y Máster en Dirección y Gestión de Recursos Humanos por la Fundación Escuela de Negocios de Andalucía (ESNA). Trabaja como psicólogo clínico pero desde hace unos años se dedica principalmente a la formación y gestión de los Recursos Humanos.\nEl título de su charla es «Cuando falla la profecía: por qué demostrar que algo no es real no sirve para nada». Él mismo nos resume el contenido:\n A menudo pensamos que, cuando alguien tiene una creencia irracional, el presentar pruebas de la falsedad de la misma es suficiente para que la persona en cuestión vea su error. No es así, debido, entre otras cosas, a un mecanismo llamado disonancia cognitiva. En la ponencia veremos cómo la gente puede pensar que el Apocalipsis va a llegar y seguir creyendo en ello cuando la fecha marcada pasa y el mundo sigue rodando. Va a ser un viaje sorprendente.  El cartel, confeccionado de nuevo por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) a partir de una imagen inspirada por el ponente y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es el siguiente:\n Escépticos en el Pub - Octubre 2013   La charla tendrá lugar el próximo Sábado 5 de Octubre de 2013 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30.

    "body": " El comienzo de la nueva temporada de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid estaba en principio previsto para Octubre, pero finalmente hemos sumado una charla más y con ello el curso 2013-2014 empezará este próximo Domingo 22 de Septiembre. No hemos querido desaprovechar la oportunidad de contar en Madrid con Eparquio Delgado (@eparquiodelgado) por un doble motivo. Primero porque en ARP-SAPC le debemos un premio y segundo porque queremos que nos hable sobre un tema que merece toda nuestra atención.\nEparquio es Licenciado en Psicología y Máster en Psicología Clínica y de la Salud por la Universidad de La Laguna. Ha trabajado desde 2005 como psicólogo en el ámbito de la exclusión social y desde 2008 dirige el Centro Psicológico Rayuela en Tenerife. Saltó al plano nacional en 2012 cuando encabezó como militante una propuesta para que Izquierda Unida aprobase una resolución de rechazo a la homeopatía y el resto de terapias pseudocientíficas. La propuesta fue aprobada en la X Asamblea Federal de IU celebrada en Diciembre de 2012. A partir de ese momento Izquierda Unida debe defender únicamente las prácticas sanitarias basadas en el conocimiento empírico demostrado. Por haber impulsado que una formación política nacional asuma la defensa de estos principios, los socios de ARP-SAPC decidimos durante nuestra Asamblea General de 2013, concederle nuestro muy valorado premio Mario Bohoslavsky 2013.\nARP-SAPC otorga el premio Mario Bohoslavsky a aquellas personas ajenas a la asociación que se han distinguido por impulsar el desarrollo de la ciencia, el pensamiento crítico, la divulgación y la educación científica, y el uso de la razón.\nAdemás de recibir el premio, hemos querido que Eparquio nos hable de lo que mejor conoce: la psicología y, más específicamente, aquellas partes de la misma invadidas (o amenazadas) por la pseudociencia. El título de su charla será «La casa por el tejado: pseudociencia en la psicología». Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n La psicología académica y aplicada ha hecho un gran esfuerzo en las últimas décadas para convertirse en una disciplina científica. Sin embargo, algunos profesionales siguen sin darse por enterados y utilizan en su ejercicio profesional técnicas, intervenciones o síndromes que no cuentan con evidencias y cuyo uso sólo se puede entender por ignorancia del método científico, por una preferencia por planteamientos esotéricas o por razones ideológicas. El objetivo de la conferencia es dar a conocer algunos ejemplos de pseudociencia en la psicología con el fin de que concienciar a los participantes de lo importante que es mantener una actitud crítica cuando se requieren los servicios de un profesional de la salud mental.  El cartel, confeccionado de nuevo por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) a partir de una imagen inspirada por el ponente y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es el siguiente:\n Escépticos en el Pub - Septiembre 2013   La charla tendrá lugar el próximo Domingo 22 de Septiembre de 2013 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30.

    "title": "Cita con Rama de Arthur C. Clarke",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " El hecho de querer valorar justamente en Goodreads los grandes clásicos que leí de pequeño me está obligando a releer deliciosas obras maestras.\nEn esta ocasión ha sido Cita con Rama, de Arthur C. Clarke. Pocas obras han tenido su impacto, fue devorado por el público y siempre viajó acompañada de grandes críticas. Ganó tras su publicación en 1973 múltiples premios, destacando el Premio Nébula, el Premio Hugo y el Premio Locus. Tuvo continuación más de 15 años después, pero el propio Clarke siempre afirmó que no pensó en hacer una saga, a pesar de la fantástica y sugerente última frase de la novela.\nEl ritmo de la novela es trepidante, cuenta mucho e insinúa muchísimo más. Es verdaderamente historia de la Ciencia Ficción, y un ejemplo brillante, meritorio y asombroso, planteando realidades alternativas inimaginables pero totalmente viables y justificadas desde cualquier plano científico, social o político. Es una obra clave, y 40 años después de su publicación sigue planteando misterios y dilemas que podrían ser reales y llegar en un futuro no muy lejano.\nHa despertado en mí incluso algunas ideas para planes presentes o futuros. Es extraño que no lea más obras de este autor, todo hasta ahora me ha maravillado (empezando por 2001: A Space Odissey).\nTotalmente recomendable, y además se lee muy rápido. Apuesto a que si leen este fragmento (es el inicio del libro, no son spóilers) querrán conocer lo que pasa a continuación.\nFue en esta contingencia cuando las computadoras comenzaron a lanzar su señal \"Tenemos algo interesante\", y por primera vez 31/439 captó la atención de los seres humanos. Hubo una breve ráfaga de excitación en el centro de operaciones de Vigilancia Espacial y el vagabundo interestelar fue pronto honrado con un nombre en lugar de un simple número. Mucho tiempo atrás los astrónomos habían agotado las mitologías griega y romana; ahora estaban recorriendo el panteón hindú. Y así, 31/439 fue bautizado \" Rama\". Durante unos días, los medios de difusión armaron gran alboroto alrededor del visitante, pero la escasez de información los ponía en desventaja. Sólo dos hechos se conocían acerca de Rama: su órbita insólita y su tamaño aproximado. Aún esto último era simplemente una conjetura, basada en la fuerza del eco del radar. A través del telescopio, Rama aparecía aún como una débil estrella de decimoquinta magnitud, demasiado pequeña para mostrar un disco visible. Pero mientras se precipitaba hacia el corazón del sistema solar, se tornaría más brillante y grande de mes en mes; antes de que se desvaneciera para siempre en el espacio, los observatorios orbitales podrían reunir información más precisa acerca de su forma y dimensiones. Había tiempo de sobra, y tal vez durante los próximos años alguna nave espacial en el curso de sus actividades normales se acercaría lo suficiente a Rama como para obtener buenas fotografías. Un encuentro verdadero era improbable; el costo de la energía necesaria, para permitir el contacto físico con un objeto que atravesaba las órbitas de los planetas a más de cien mil kilómetros por hora, sería demasiado alto. En consecuencia, el mundo se olvidó pronto de Rama. No así los astrónomos. La excitación de estos aumentó con el correr de los meses, mientras el nuevo asteroide los obsequiaba con más y más enigmas. Para empezar, estaba el problema de la curva de luz de Rama. No la tenía. Todos los asteroides conocidos, sin excepción, mostraban una lenta variación en su brillo, que aumentaba y disminuía en un lapso de horas. Desde hacía más de dos siglos, ésto se reconocía como el resultado inevitable de su rotación y de su forma irregular. Mientras giraban a lo largo de sus órbitas, las superficies reflejadas que presentaban al Sol cambiaban de continuo y su brillo variaba de acuerdo con ello. Rama no mostraba tales cambios. O bien no giraba, o era perfectamente simétrico. Ambas explicaciones parecían improbables. El asunto quedó paralizado durante varios meses, porque no se podía distraer a ninguno de los grandes telescopios orbitales de su tarea regular de husmear en las remotas profundidades del universo. La astronomía del espacio era una afición muy costosa, y utilizar uno de los grandes instrumentos podía fácilmente costar mil dólares el minuto. El doctor William Stenton jamás habría podido echar mano del Miralejos, el reflector de doscientos metros durante todo un cuarto de hora, si un programa más importante no hubiera sido interrumpido temporalmente como consecuencia del fallo de un capacitador de cincuenta centavos. La mala suerte de un astrónomo supuso buena fortuna para Stenton. Stenton no supo qué había captado hasta el día siguiente, cuando consiguió tiempo de computadora para procesar los resultados obtenidos. Aun cuando éstos fueron finalmente proyectados en su pantalla, tardó varios minutos en comprender su significado. La luz del sol reflejada sobre la superficie de Rama no era, en fin de cuentas, absolutamente constante en su intensidad. Existía una muy ligera variación, difícil de detectar pero inconfundible y extremadamente irregular. Como el resto de asteroides, Rama giraba. Pero mientras el día normal de un asteroide era de varias horas, el de Rama sólo duraba cuatro minutos. Stenton hizo algunos cálculos rápidos, y le costó mucho creer en los resultados. En su ecuador, ese mundo diminuto debía estar girando a más de mil kilómetros por hora. Seria muy poco aconsejable intentar un descenso en cualquier punto de Rama excepto en sus polos, ya que la fuerza centrífuga en el ecuador sería lo bastante poderosa como para sacudirse de encima cualquier objeto suelto a una aceleración de casi gravedad uno. Rama era un canto rodado al que jamás habría podido adherirse ningún moho cósmico. Asombraba pensar que un cuerpo semejante hubiese logrado mantenerse en el espacio, que no se hubiera desintegrado mucho antes en un millón de fragmentos. Un objeto que medía cuarenta kilómetros de largo, con un período de rotación de apenas cuatro minutos... ¿dónde encajaba eso dentro del esquema astronómico? El doctor Stenton era un hombre un tanto imaginativo, también un tanto propenso a sacar conclusiones precipitadas. Ahora había llegado a una conclusión que durante unos minutos hizo que se sintiera bastante incómodo. [...] Cualquier masa estelar que se introdujera en el sistema solar alteraría por completo las órbitas de los planetas. La Tierra sólo tenía que moverse unos pocos millones de kilómetros hacia el sol, o hacia las estrellas, para que el delicado equilibrio del clima se rompiera. Los hielos antárticos se derretirían anegando las tierras bajas, o los océanos se helarían y el mundo entero quedaría envuelto en un invierno eterno. Un simple empujoncito en una u otra dirección bastaría... Luego Stenton se relajó y lanzó un suspiro de alivio. Qué tontería; debería avergonzarse de sí mismo. Rama no podía en manera alguna estar formado de materia condensada. Ninguna masa del tamaño de una estrella podía penetrar tan profundamente en el sistema solar sin producir perturbaciones que hubieran revelado su existencia mucho antes. Las órbitas de todos los planetas habrían sido afectadas; no de otra manera —a fin de cuentas— se había efectuado el descubrimiento de Neptuno, Plutón y Persefone. No; era absolutamente imposible que un objeto tan pesado como un sol muerto pudiera haberse deslizado en el espacio interplanetario sin que se reparara en él. En cierto modo, era una lástima. Un encuentro con una estrella oscura habría sido de lo más excitante. Mientras durase…  ",

    "body": " El Sábado 11 de Mayo tendremos una nueva edición de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid y el título deja claro el contenido: Médicos, curas, homeópatas y brujas: a la conquista del efecto placebo\nEn esta ocasión el ponente será Ignacio García Ribas, Licenciado en Medicina por la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid y desde su época de estudiante especializado en Oncología. Hizo su tesis doctoral en el Imperial Cancer Research Fund en Londres investigando sobre terapia génica para el cáncer. Desde entonces trabaja en en investigación clínica desarrollando nuevos fármacos para el tratamiento del cáncer.\nTras una introducción sobre el significado de la enfermedad y la muerte en el ser humano, Ignacio analizará el efecto placebo y su importancia, desde su mal uso o abuso por parte de curanderos y estafadores, sin dejar de analizar el uso y regulación de dicho efecto placebo en investigación clínica seria. Como es habitual el propio Ignacio nos ha enviado un resumen de su charla:\n El efecto placebo se define como el beneficio observado en un enfermo cuando se le administra un tratamiento inerte. Es un efecto bien conocido aunque no demasiado estudiado. Afecta especialmente a la investigación clínica de medicamentos que tratan síntomas (por ejemplo el dolor) pero también está en la base de muchas terapéuticas alternativas que no han demostrado sus beneficios de manera formal.

    "body": " Encuentro en mi buzón la respuesta de la Defensora del Espectador de RTVE a mi queja por la masiva programación religiosa impropia en un medio público de un Estado aconfesional. La petición iba en la misma línea que la queja realizada por Europa Laica y el Observatorio del Laicismo.\nLes dejo a continuación la respuesta verbatim, es decir, no he cambiado ni una coma.\n Apreciado comunicante:  Gracias por dirigirse a la oficina de la defensora con sus observaciones. La Constitución Española en el Artículo 16, punto 3 dice: “Ninguna confesión tendrá carácter estatal. Los poderes públicos tendrán en cuenta las creencias religiosas de la sociedad española y mantendrán las consiguientes relaciones de cooperación con la Iglesia Católica y las demás confesiones”. RTVE cumple el mandato constitucional y, no solo emite programas del credo católico, sino que también da espacio a las confesiones evangélica, judía y musulmana, conforme a su arraigo en España. En virtud de las decisiones del Consejo de Administración del ente público RTVE de septiembre de 1982 se estableció y reguló el procedimiento para que los programas religiosos tuvieran presencia en la programación de RTVE. Una presencia que no se formalizó hasta la entrada en vigor de la Ley 17/2006 de la radio y la televisión de titularidad estatal. Así, de acuerdo con la legislación que es de aplicación en este momento en RTVE, en la que se reconoce el derecho de acceso, se ofrecen programas de la religión católica, evangélica, judía y musulmana. La defensora no puede solicitar a dirección de la empresa el incumplimiento de las decisiones adoptadas por el Consejo de Administración. Mi tarea es velar por el derecho ciudadano a recibir una información veraz, plural e independiente y un entretenimiento digno. Con respecto a lo que indica el Manual de Estilo de RTVE en su apartado 5.15 acerca de la Información sobre confesiones religiosas, desde el punto de vista legal, de igualdad, conocimiento, cobertura de las celebraciones, libertad de opinión y crítica, lo relativo a la Iglesia Católica o la exigencia de que no se haga proselitismo, los profesionales se ajustan a la norma. Y cuando no ha sido así y la Oficina de la defensora ha tenido conocimiento de que algún periodista en su ejercicio profesional se ha desviado de estos principios, se ha reflejado en los Informes trimestrales que realiza y que están colgados en la web www.rtve.es/defensora. Las decisiones de programación y contenidos no están entre las competencias de la defensora del espectador de acuerdo a lo establecido en el Estatuto que rige su tarea y que enlazamos por si fuera de su interés: http://www.rtve.es/contenidos/documentos/Estatuto_defensora.pdf. Este asunto ha sido tratado en varias ocasiones en RTVE Responde, el programa de la defensora. En él, distintos responsables de RTVE han explicado el porqué de la emisión de programas religiosos en nuestros canales. Así mismo, han comparecido en el programa distintos responsables de programación y contenidos para explicar el criterio con el que se deciden las coberturas informativas de ciertos acontecimientos de carácter religioso. La dirección de TVE ha recibido el escrito que dirigió a la defensora del espectador el Observatorio del Laicismo. Reciba un cordial saludo. Oficina de la defensora  Es decir, que en su opinión se ajusta a la legalidad y que se da espacio a todas las confesiones pero conforme a su arraigo, ¡claro!\nDeberíamos reclamar la cuota del FSM.\n",

    "body": " El próximo Sábado 6 de Abril tendremos una nueva edición de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid con un tema muy apropiado para estas fechas. Además de una gran charla, finalmente hemos encontrado la ocasión perfecta para usar como cartel el magnífico trabajo de restauración de Cecilia Giménez.\nEl ponente será Miguel Ángel Sabadell, Licenciado en Astrofísica por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid y Doctor en Física Teórica en la Universidad de Zaragoza. Es editor de Ciencia en la revista Muy Interesante y autor del blog La Ciencia de tu Vida (@cienciadetuvida).\nComo es habitual el propio Miguel Ángel nos ha enviado un resumen de su charla:\n En 1985 Robert W. Funk creaba el Jesus Seminar, un grupo formado por un centenar de académicos neotestamentarios con el objetivo de elucidar, utilizando la antropología, la historia y el análisis textual, qué pudo y qué no pudo decir Jesús. Y la polémica, que se había encontrado latente a lo largo de todo el siglo XX, estalló. La razón es obvia: además de sesudos artículos y libros, los miembros del seminario se dedicaron de manera consistente a sacar su postura en los medios de comunicación una visión de Jesús muy diferente a la por todos conocida. El tranquilo mundo de la investigación neotestamentaria, en manos de católicos y protestantes, se vio sacudido por el terremoto mediático de la década de los 90. Nuevas imágenes de Jesús aparecieron por autores no vinculados a ninguna iglesia y las viejas posturas recibieron un fuerte impacto bajo la acusación de haber entorpecido y enmascarado al verdadero Jesús. Una idea debemos tener presente: la investigación histórica del Nazareno, el que realmente vivió y murió en Galilea, está y estará siempre en la cuerda floja. “No existe una Suiza neutral en el investigación sobre Jesús”, afirma el sacerdote católico John P. Meier, profesor de Nuevo Testamento en la Universidad de Notre-Dame en Indiana, EE UU. No es lo mismo que estudiar a Sócrates o a Alejandro Magno. En rarísimas ocasiones se ha dado el caso que un historiador confesional haya llegado a conclusiones distintas a las que soporta su fe. Y si no es así, se puede prever qué sucederá: como le ocurrió a la teóloga Uta Ranke-Heinemann, autora del polémico libro No y amén, compañera de estudios del anterior Papa y la primera mujer en ser profesora de teología en una universidad católica, de donde fue separada de su cargo al interpretar la virginidad de María en un sentido únicamente teológico y no biológico. La vida de Jesús, tal y como nos ha llegado, es totalmente sobrenatural: nacido de una virgen, autor de portentosos milagros y, sobre todo, resucitado de la muerte. Ya lo dijo Pablo de Tarso: “si no resucitó Cristo, vana es nuestra predicación, vana también vuestra fe”. En este sentido, la historicidad de la resurrección, que el Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica sostiene en base al testimonio recogido en los evangelios, es clave para entender las peleas y debates que en la última mitad del siglo XX se han producido en el ámbito universitario y que se conocen como The Jesus Wars, las Guerras de Jesús. Por eso “el estudio histórico de Jesús es un cómodo lugar para hacer teología y llamarlo historia”, comenta uno de los más polémicos estudiosos neotestamentarios, John Dominique Crossan. El Jesús histórico no se resolverá jamás. Cada cual arrima el ascua a su sardina e intenta ajustarlo a su propia ideología. Cualquier investigación histórica adolece de suficientes lagunas para poder bailar con los hechos hasta acomodarlos a nuestras concepciones previas. Si existen personas capaces de negar el holocausto nazi, ¿qué no puede hacerse con una figura de hace 2.000 años del cual la única información que se tiene es la que proporcionan sus propios seguidores? La investigación sobre el Jesús histórico presenta una clara falla: la escasa investigación antropológica y psicológica de cómo se construyen las historias míticas y religiosas. Entender porqué aparecieron y triunfaron movimientos más modernos, con un origen netamente sobrenatural, como el espiritismo –a los dos años de su nacimiento en 1848 aglutinaba a más de 8 millones de seguidores– o el más reciente de los contactos con extraterrestres, quizá proporcionen alguna luz sobre el nacimiento de las religiones y sobre la fiabilidad de las fuentes. De todas formas, en Jesús se hace cierto lo que el físico teórico Werner Heisenberg dijo en broma de su propia especialidad: “cuando los hechos no concuerdan con la teoría, es un problema exclusivo de los hechos”.  El cartel, confeccionado de nuevo por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) a partir de una imagen seleccionada por el propio ponente y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es el siguiente:\n Escépticos en el Pub - Abril 2013   La charla tendrá lugar el próximo 6 de Abril de 2013 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30.

    "body": " El próximo Sábado 16 de Marzo vuelve Escépticos en el Pub Madrid, con un tema que esperamos genere un buen debate, con un sano e interesante intercambio de opiniones.\nLa charla será impartida por Almudena Martínez, humanista y sexóloga, y Montse Ibañez, matemática. Cuentan que se conocieron en un curso sobre sexualidad humana, y desde entonces vienen definiendo lo que consideran una visión novedosa sobre el erotismo y la sexualidad. Esto con el tiempo les llevó a fundar su propia consultora especializada en sexualidad: Cassire (@cassireworld)\nAprovechando su experiencia tratando estos asuntos, les hemos pedido que vengan a hablarnos sobre lo que muchos consideran un mito, otros es intocable y para algunos incluso algo inalcanzable: la monogamia. En sus propias palabras:\n ¿En qué momento de tu vida optaste por la monogamia? ¿Crees que es el único esquema de relación emocional que funciona? ¿Adoptarías otro si tuvieras la opción? ¿Conoces a gente infiel? ¿Y a gente estrictamente monógama? La monogamia no es el único esquema de relaciones interpersonales que existe. Tampoco es el único que funciona. Ni siquiera es el más satisfactorio para algunos de los individuos que optan por ella. Os proponemos una charla informal donde abordaremos el mito de la monogamia, su efectividad como esquema de relaciones interpersonales, algunas de las razones por las que se adopta como opción vital, las alternativas que existen y el grado de satisfacción que individuos con determinados requisitos y expectativas obtienen de ellas.

    "title": "Crónica de una visita guiada al CERN",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "  (Entrada publicada también en el blog de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica)  Hace unos días publiqué una Guía para visitar el CERN que tuvo bastante éxito y mucha gente me ha solicitado más información sobre la visita. Para completar en lo posible, aunque sin entrar a valorar aquello que puede encontrarse fácilmente en Google sobre el CERN, voy a relatar mi visita añadiendo toda la información de tipo práctico que crea útil.\nUna vez en Ginebra, al CERN se puede llegar fácil y rápidamente tanto en coche como en transporte público. Hay un parking de visitantes gratuito y muchos tranvías y autobuses llegan hasta la puerta, es la forma de acceso habitual para los trabajadores e investigadores del centro\nEn la misma entrada al complejo, junto al parking y a las paradas de tranvía, se encuentra el Centro de Visitantes, que alberga la recepción, algunas de las exposiciones (abiertas al público incluso sin reserva previa), la tienda y la zona de espera para las visitas guiadas. El suelo de la entrada hace que la expectación crezca.\n Entrada al Centro de Visitantes del CERN — CC BY-SA    Para evitar problemas lo recomendable es llegar un rato antes de la cita para la visita guiada. Además aprovecharás el tiempo de espera viendo varias exposiciones. En el mismo Centro de Visitantes hay varios pasillos con información histórica, política y económica acerca del CERN. Superada esta parte algo más áspera conviene llegar hasta la exposición Microcosmos, situada en la planta inferior. Desde un punto de vista totalmente didáctico se explica, en muchas ocasiones con vídeos y audios de los propios investigadores, qué se hace en el CERN, por qué se hace y en buena medida cómo se investiga allí.\nAl final de Microcosmos hay varias salas más destinadas a explicaciones más técnicas y específicas sobre los instrumentos y laboratorios que están o estuvieron en uso. Para tus cálculos, estos paseos por exposiciones, tienda, etc. te llevarán de una a dos horas en función del interés que tengas. Según el tiempo del que dispongas también podrás verlo más deprisa o más despacio, hay varios vídeos para sentarse tranquilamente. En la zona destinada al LHC podrás hacerte una foto tan divertida como esta:\n Lo más parecido a recorrer los túneles del LHC sin recorrerlos — CC BY-SA    La visita guiada comienza con un vídeo de unos 25-30 minutos sobre la institución. Tras el vídeo llega la persona que guiará al grupo en la visita. En nuestro caso fue un Ingeniero Industrial italiano que se encuentra allí investigando aplicaciones concretas en el área sanitaria utilizando datos extraídos en el LHC. Parte de su trabajo allí, quizá como requisito para algún tipo de beca, le obliga a realizar un par de veces al mes visitas guiadas al centro. La primera de sus funciones después de presentarse es confirmar el contenido de la visita guiada, que puede variar según la disponibilidad de las instalaciones por los experimentos que allí se llevan a cabo. En nuestro caso la visita en detalle fue al experimento ATLAS, que forma parte del LHC (Large Hadron Collider).\nCon nuestro simpático guía italiano salimos del Centro de Visitantes y paseamos por las instalaciones. Junto al Globo de la Ciencia y la Innovación nos detuvimos otro rato para recibir explicaciones más concretas del propio LHC. En la foto podemos ver al grupo junto a una réplica de la tubería por la que viajan los protones en el interior del enorme túnel circular de 27 kilómetros del LHC que originalmente se construyó para el colisionador LEP (Large Electron-Positron):\n Réplica de la tubería del LHC — CC BY-SA    Continuamos el paseo para entrar al recinto restringido del experimento ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus), que se encuentra junto al Centro de Visitantes. ATLAS es uno de los siete detectores de partículas situados a lo largo del LHC destinados a observar y analizar la materia y partículas generadas por el choque de partículas a gran velocidad.\nEl propio aparato se encuentra, como el resto del túnel del LHC, a unos 200 metros de profundidad. Como nota simpática, parte del edificio en superficie está pintando simulando el propio detector, con una sutil diferencia en la escala. El detector ATLAS es el doble de grande que ese edificio. Mide unos 45 metros de longitud, tiene 25 metros de diámetro y pesa alrededor de 7.000 toneladas. Como equivalencia para dummies, pesa tanto como la Torre Eiffel.\n El edificio en superficie del Experimento ATLAS — CC BY-SA    Entre las cosas interesantes que se encuentran en superficie está la Sala de Control de ATLAS, con las típicas pantallas gigantes y varios monitores en cada puesto. Un sitio genial para trabajar, dejando de lado la sensación de ver continuamente gente mirando todo lo que haces por un cristal. Además, parte del edificio está orientado a la divulgación y contiene muchísima información sobre el experimento, por ejemplo en una sala especial para visitantes se proyecta un documental en 3D sobre la construcción del LHC.\n Sala de Control del experimento ATLAS — CC BY-SA    Tras el habitual turno de ruegos y preguntas la visita termina de nuevo en la zona de acceso público en el Globo de la Ciencia y la Innovación, que contiene la exposición permanente Universo de Partículas y varios de los objetos destacados del CERN, como el primer acelerador circular de partículas y el primer servidor web, con el que por supuesto me hice una foto. Además, cada cierto tiempo se apagan del todo las luces y se proyecta en todas direcciones de forma muy atractiva y envolvente un vídeo sobre física de partículas, que abarca desde la física más básica a la teoría de cuerdas, desde el Big Bang hasta la actualidad.\n Proyección del Universo de Partículas en el CERN — CC BY-SA    En definitiva, un paseo terriblemente interesante de unas tres o cuatro horas que no deben perderse si tienen ocasión de pasar por Ginebra. Como ya digo gran parte de la visita se puede hacer sin reserva previa de forma gratuita.\nUn buen consejo para concluir. Tras 3 años de funcionamiento, esta próxima primavera el LHC va a detenerse durante varios meses para realizar varias mejoras en las instalaciones y poder afrontar un aumento considerable de potencia a partir de 2015. Les recomiendo aprovechar el parón para poder optar a bajar en la visita guiada al túnel del LHC y ver de cerca alguno de los detectores situados a lo largo del mismo. Yo desde luego volveré para completar mi visita.\n¡Espero que lo disfruten!\n",

    "body": "  (Entrada publicada también en el blog de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica)  Dentro de tres días, el próximo Miércoles 30 de Enero, estaré en Ginebra para una visita que llevo mucho tiempo planeando: la Organización Europea para la Investigación Nuclear que todos conocemos por sus siglas en francés CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire).\nTras una introducción para despistados (muy despistados) entraré al propósito de esta entrada, una guía rápida y fácil para visitar el CERN, dado que es mucho más sencillo y asequible de lo que la gente cree.\n¿Qué es el CERN? Fundado en 1954 por 12 países, fue en su día uno de los primeros proyectos conjuntos a nivel europeo. Actualmente son 20 los países europeos que son miembros y se mantienen acuerdos de colaboración con centros y países de todo el mundo.\nCERN logo by l0b0 — CC BY-NC-SA   El CERN es uno de los mayores y más importantes centro de investigación a nivel mundial, y concretamente en lo referente a investigación en física de partículas no hay nada similar. Tiene varios hitos importantes para el mundo de la física:\n En 1957 construyen el SC (Synchrocyclotron), el primer acelerador de partículas, que funcionó hasta 1990 En 1971 el ISR (Intersecting Storage Rings), el primer colisionador de protones a nivel mundial En 1976 se inicia el SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron), el primer gran anillo del CERN con un túnel circular de 7 km de diámetro En 1989 se construye el LEP (Large Electron-Positron), un colisionador cuyo túnel en forma de anillo de 27 kilómetros sigue siendo el mayor jamás construido En 2008 se enciende por primera vez el LHC (Large Hadron Collider), utilizando el túnel creado para LEP en 1989 a 100 metros de profundidad.  Además del impacto social y científico por sus avances en ciencia y física básicas, el CERN también es esencial para el mundo de la informática. En las Navidades de 1990, Tim Berners-Lee y Robert Cailliau definen en el CERN los conceptos básicos de la World Wide Web: URL, http y html, escribiendo además el código para el primer navegador, el primer servidor web y las primeras páginas web (sobre su propio proyecto).\nInicialmente se utilizó sólo de forma interna y poco a poco se extendió a otros centros de investigación. Contando ya con más de 10 millones de usuarios, en 1994 el CERN libera la WWW para el Dominio Público, asegurando que se mantenga para siempre como un estándar abierto. Nace entonces el W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) cuya sede se traslada al MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)  WHERE THE WEB WAS BORN by Max Braun — CC BY-SA    ¿Por qué debo visitar el CERN? Si has llegado hasta aquí y te preguntas esto, por favor pulsa Alt-F4.\nPero vamos, la respuesta es sencilla (¡elige la tuya!):\n Porque es la prueba (como si hiciera falta) de lo bien que se pueden hacer las cosas cuando se olvidan las jodidas nacionalidades porque fue un proyecto que nació con fines meramente pacíficos entre países en tensión y en época de guerra fría. Porque no hay muchos sitios donde veas colaborar a centenares de Doctores, con miles de Ingenieros, de decenas de países y cientos de universidades. Lo más parecido a la Federación de Planetas Unidos que podrás encontrar. ...  ¿Qué se puede visitar? La visita en total tiene una duración prevista de unas 3 horas. En función de las áreas disponibles en ese momento hay varios circuitos temáticos posibles, que se decidirán al principio de la visita. En función del itinerario se podrá visitar alguno de los principales complejos: el centro de control de los aceleradores, el COMPASS, AD, CAST, AMS, el CLIC (un estudio sobre cómo serán los aceleradores del futuro) y por supuesto las zonas visitables del LHC. Hay además un itinerario específico sobre Tecnologías de la Información, computación y comunicaciones.\nAdemás de estos posibles itinerarios, siempre están disponibles las exposiciones temporales Universo de Partículas, el Globo de la Ciencia y la Innovación y Microcosmos.\n The Globe of Science and Innovation by @MrTopf — CC BY-NC    ¿Cómo reservar una visita? La información sobre las visitas al CERN es clara y precisa, el proceso es sencillo y casi inmediato. La visita es totalmente gratuita, aunque la tienda de souvenirs hará temblar mi tarjeta de crédito.\nEl punto complicado es que hay pocas visitas, mucha demanda y pocas plazas en cada visita (unas 15-20 personas). Además, las visitas son únicamente en inglés o francés. Si sólo te sirve en inglés lo tendrás mucho más difícil y tendrás que reservar con mucha antelación. Para terminar de rematarlo, las visitas son de Lunes a Sábado (salvo festivos), es altamente probable que si necesitas ir un sábado tengas que añadir mucha más antelación.\nOtra opción es que tengas la opción de hacer como pude hacer yo, ver hueco un Miércoles por la mañana y tirarte al barro reservando. Una vez hecho lo difícil (encontrar plaza) explicarle a mi jefe el asunto es asequible.\n¿Cómo llegar al CERN? Asumiendo que no te pilla bien en coche o tren, la alternativa fácil es llegar en avión, Ginebra es un destino probable desde un montón de ciudades. Todos sabemos buscar vuelos, sólo os diré que yo encontré un vuelo de Air Europa con unos horarios fantásticos por menos de 100 euros. Además, Pepephone es una maravilla y me paga el viaje de vuelta, por lo que sólo voy a pagar 60,52 €.\nUna vez en Ginebra la mejor opción para llegar al CERN es el autobús. Desde el aeropuerto hay autobuses cada 10 minutos, el trayecto es de unos 40 minutos. En el aeropuerto puedes solicitar una tarjeta que te permite coger un autobús sin coste en los siguientes 80 minutos. Desde el centro de la ciudad hay autobuses cada 15 minutos, siendo el trayecto de unos 25 minutos. Casi todos los hoteles y buena parte de los apartamentos también ofrecen tarjetas de transporte gratuito.\nPara los comodones, un taxi desde el aeropuerto serán unos 25 euros, algo menos si es desde el centro de Ginebra.\n¿Dónde dormir? Mi opción está clara, yo me alojaré en casa de una adorable señora llamada Susan que he encontrado a través de Airbnb, hay muchísimas y variadas opciones en Ginebra. Susan vive en una amplia y soleada casa independiente, muy cerca del centro y con aparcamiento privado y tras negociarlo un poco me cobra 65€ por noche para dos personas con desayuno incluido.\nEl CERN ofrece su propio servicio de alojamiento, con un Hotel y apartamentos, destinado a investigadores e ingenieros de visita temporal. Si hay habitaciones libres se podrá reservar, siempre que tengas ya la visita a las instalaciones solicitada y confirmada, por unos 60-70 euros por persona y noche.\nEn Ginebra hay muchas más opciones de alojamiento, el CERN mantiene una lista de hoteles recomendados y en algún caso con condiciones especiales par visitantes.\n CERN / Plan of SPS to LHC transfer tunnels by @arselectronica — CC BY-NC-ND    Conclusiones La visita al CERN me va a costar unos 60 euros de vuelo (todo incluido) y unos 65 euros la noche en habitación doble. Podríamos poner también como gasto un par de días de vacaciones. Yo lo amplío un poco y veré más cosas, pero limitando el viaje a visitar el CERN no es nada caro ni difícil.\nComo nota curiosa (y patética), todos los países que entraron como miembros lo siguieron siendo hasta la actualidad, con excepción de España que se incorporó en 1961 para luego retirarse en 1969 y volver a unirse en 1983 (hasta la actualidad). Al paso que vamos quizá nos echen a patadas, hace unos días se supo que España debía al CERN en Diciembre más de 110 millones de Euros, correspondientes a todo 2011 y 2012. En parte por el escándalo se acabó por pagar 2011 y sólo un 25% de lo correspondiente a 2012, dejando a 31 de Diciembre la deuda en 50 millones de euros. Para 2013 a España le corresponde aportar unos 75 millones más, pero en los Presupuestos Generales del Estado sólo se contempla un pago de 50 millones de euros, que es lo que se debe de 2012. Si no se consigue pagar lo acordado el CERN tendrá que asignarnos un status distinto, con consecuencias importantes y pésimas para el país, suponiendo por ejemplo que España pierda el derecho a voto y muchísimo peso.\n",

    "body": " Algunos recordaréis (y los que no, ya lo sabéis) que en Julio del pasado año tuve el placer de participar en la PiWeek (Personal Innovation Week), una iniciativa muy interesante por parte de Kaleidos (una empresa madrileña orientada al software libre con la que tengo únótimë lazos). Esta iniciativa consiste en permitir cada seis meses que durante una semana completa todos los empleados de la empresa organicen y participen en proyectos totalmente personales (suyos o de otro compañero). No es necesario que sean ‘productivos’ y mucho menos ‘vendibles’. Los únicos requisitos básicamente son (ellos lo detallan mejor):\n que sea algo innovador, especialmente en la parte técnica que utilice exclusivamente software libre que el Viernes a mediodía se pueda presentar una versión completa y funcional (esto no impide que el proyecto después pueda ser ampliado y/o mejorado)  En mi caso la PiWeek de Julio'12 consistió en currar de 8:00 a las 15:00 en mi empresa y aprovechar la jornada intensiva de verano para comer un bocata y trabajar hasta las mil de la madrugada en Kaleidos (y encantado de la vida). El Diario ABC llegó a hacerse eco de la experiencia (y de mi participación): Empresas españolas con mentalidad de start-ups de Silicon Valley.\nMuchos de los proyectos han acabado viendo la luz, siempre con licencia GPL o similar, y alguno incluso salen a Producción en la misma semana.\n  El proyecto en el que participé quedó casi terminado en Julio, pero finalmente no se completó en verano y en la PiWeek de Diciembre 2012 (en la que por desgracia apenas pude participar) se terminaron varios flecos y se quedó todo listo para la siguiente publicación de datos de la Encuesta de Población Activa. El Instituto Nacional de Estadística ha publicado la EPA esta misma mañana y tras cierto tratamiento de los microdatos que publican ya está este último trimestre de 2012 incorporado y ya hemos abierto el acceso libre en producción a la herramienta:\n Entra y consulta cuál es tu verdadera tasa de paro!!  Además de la parte puramente personal e interesada, he aprendido y estoy disfrutando muchísimo en el proyecto, creemos que es una herramienta muy interesante y bastante útil. Son datos reales, públicos y accesibles, sólo era necesario que alguien los tratara. La única limitación es que no dejan de ser datos extrapolados a partir de una encuesta, aunque sea del volumen de la EPA.\nHabitualmente los medios de comunicación destacan de la EPA únicamente la cifra de paro global (actualmente el 26%) y como mucho limitan su interés a ciertos colectivos: Hombres (26%), Mujeres (27%) o por Comunidades Autónomas. Si tienes mucha suerte quizá encuentres el dato de tu provincia. Pero tenemos todos los datos:\n   Se puede extraer información mucho más útil, y esta es sólo una posible aproximación. Quiero saber cuál es realmente mi tasa de paro, la mía. Quiero saber en qué afecta a mi tasa de paro un cambio de domicilio, un esfuerzo en formación. Quiero saber en qué situación está alguien con mi perfil con unos pocos años más. Quiero saber cómo ha cambiado el paro para mi perfil en todos los datos trimestrales de EPA que ha publicado el INE (empezó en 2005). Y por supuesto, quiero saberlo de mi perfil y de cualquier otro perfil, ¡es información pública!\n   Os pido por favor que deis la máxima difusión a la aplicación, hemos puesto el típico botón para que podáis compartir en Twitter vuestra propia tasa de paro.\nPara los curiosos: El proyecto en el que he participado se llevó a cabo (por decisión de los miembros del equipo encargados de cada parte) en R y Python, y tuvo como tecnologías base, entre otras: django, backbone.js, Node.js, Less CSS, jQuery y Raphaël. Todo a través de una API REST que también publicaremos en el futuro para que otros puedan beneficiarse de los datos ya procesados.\nHan colaborado varias personas de desarrollo, maquetación, usabilidad e incluso marketing, aunque hay que destacar el monumental trabajo de Yamila Moreno (@yamila_moreno) coordinando y desarrollando una grandísima parte de la aplicación.\nPara los más curiosos aún, el origen de todo está en una cena posterior a un Escépticos en el Pub en la que pude charlar con Carlos Gil Bellosta (@gilbellosta) y éste me contó la idea, lamentando no tener una forma fácil de llevarla a cabo. Él es un monstruo de R y de Estadística aplicada y además del tratamiento inicial de los datos que publica el INE ha asesorado funcionalmente durante todo el proyecto. ¡Mil gracias!\n",

No quería dejar pasar la oportunidad de recordarlo, no quedarán muchas entradas disponibles pero siguen quedando.\nTuve la gran suerte de asistir a NECSS 2012. Allí pude conocer a gente fantástica y escuchar charlas muy interesantes e inspiradoras. Soy un desastre y nunca llegué a publicar el resumen en el blog, y la crónica para la revista El Escéptico aún no se ha publicado (por mi culpa). Al menos ya llegué a colgar mis fotos de NECSS 2012 en flickr.\nViendo que se acerca la edición 2013, no puedo dejar pasar la ocasión de recomendarles el evento, verán mucho más cerca (en el amplio sentido de la palabra) a gente muy interesante. Yo por desgracia este año tendré que declinar la invitación, otros viajes parece que se llevarán el presupuesto.\n  James Randi en NECSS 2012 — CC BY-NC-SA   Pude escuchar a varios iconos (para mi) vivientes: James Randi, D.J. Grothe, Steven Novella, Rebecca Watson, PZ Myers, Massimo Pigliucci, Julia Galef,... y con varios de ellos tuve la suerte de poder conversar.\n  Con D.J. Grothe en el stand de la JREF durante NECSS 2012 — CC BY-NC-SA   Además, me encantaron y quiero destacar a otros no tan conocidos: Debbie Berebichez, John Bohannon, Ehan Brown, David Kyle Johnson, Seth Shostak y Brian Wecht.\n  Ehan Brown y su genial Cuadrado Mágico junto a Jamy Ian Swiss — CC BY-NC-SA   Una de las noches pude asistir a la grabación en directo de un episodio de The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, en una pequeña y abarrotada habitación en el Hilton de la 6ª Avenida junto a otra docena de afortunados. Entre los invitados a charlar en ese episodio estaban también The Amazing Randi, DJ Grothe y Seth Shostak.\n  De izquiera a derecha: la rodilla de Seth Shostak, la zapatilla de Jay Novella, medio Evan Bernstein, Rebecca Watson, Steven Novella, Bob Novella y James Randi — CC BY-NC-SA   Escribiendo esto me viene de nuevo todo a la cabeza, unido al resto del viaje por Washington y Nueva York, y no puedo hacer otra cosa que insistir en recomendarles ahorrar un poco y pasarse por NECSS 2013. ¡De paso pueden ver Nueva york! Es una gran conferencia, un gran grupo organizador con gente de New York City Skeptics y la New England Skeptical Society (ambas entidades educativas sin ánimo de lucro) que ha sacado adelante ya varios SkeptiCamp, que cuenta además (por si no fuera suficiente) con todo el apoyo del equipo SGU y de Massimo Pigliucci y Julia Galef de Rationally Speaking.\nMirando un poco hacia delante, además de los habituales de la Conferencia entre los ponentes previstos para 2013 están: Michael Shermer (que nos visitó hace poco en Escépticos en el Pub Madrid) Leonard Mlodinow (físico teórico especializado en mecánica cuántica y escritor entre otras cosas de The Grand Design junto a Stephen Hawking), Simon L. Singh (periodista, escritor y activista escéptico británico, al que ya reseñé en el blog por Fermat's Last Theorem) o Shaifali Puri (Directora Ejecutiva de Científicos Sin Fronteras).\nQue lástima no poder volver este año.\n",

    "body": " Sanal Edamaruku (@SanalEdamaruku) es presidente y fundador de Rationalist International agrupación a la que pertenecen (o pertenecían hasta su fallecimiento) figuras de la talla de Christopher Hitchens, Paul Kurtz, Richard Dawkins, Richard Stallman (yeah!), James Randi o Richard Wiseman entre otros. Ha trabajado durante décadas en la India promocionando la ciencia y luchando contra la superstición.\nSaltó definitivamente al panorama internacional en 2008, cuando retó a un chamán que aseguraba poder matar en tres minutos a base de recitar mantras, a que le matase en directo en televisión bajo condiciones supervisadas a prueba de fraude. El vídeo de aquello merece ser visto.\n   Sanal lógicamente sigue vivo, y consiguió con aquello que varios millones de indios vieran en directo el fracaso del chamán, cambiando en muchos casos su percepción acerca de ese tipo de superstición.\nUna de sus últimas acciones públicas fue demostrar que el agua que exudaba una figura de un cristo de madera no era otra cosa que una tubería en mal estado que mediante capilaridad filtraba agua sobre la figura. Se montó un enorme revuelo internacional y varios grupos católicos, con el apoyo de las principales autoridades católicas, le denunciaron por \"herir deliberadamente sentimientos religiosos e intentar actos maliciosos destinados a la indignación de cualquiera con sensibilidad religiosa\".\nLa legislación de la India protege la libertad de expresión, pero contiene algún artículo originalmente pensado para mantener el orden mediante la prevención de ataques entre las diferentes comunidades y minorías del país. Ese mismo resquicio es el utilizado en esta ocasión por una institución tan poderosa como la iglesia católica.\nSanal se ha mostrado totalmente dispuesto a colaborar con la Justicia y defender su causa, pero hasta la llegada del juicio (si no se retiran las denuncias) se expone a una prisión preventiva sin fianza por un periodo indefinido. Por ello, primero se encerró en su casa y tuvo que dejar de trabajar, y más tarde ha tenido incluso que exiliarse en Europa, concretamente en Finlandia. Es terrible que tuviera que salir de su país por la amenaza de ser encarcelado por ejercer su libertad de expresión, hay una petición pública para que se retiren las denuncias con varios miles de firmas. En palabras del propio Sanal:\n  It is nothing new that the Catholic bishops try to sentence their opponents to the stake when they run out of arguments. Giordano Bruno’s is a case in point. But try as they may, they cannot stop me to stand for reason, science and historic facts. And I am not alone. Freedom of expression is under attack and we are going to defend it! I can understand that they might be inspired by the stories of Inquisition and Witch Hunting in the middle ages. We live in 21st century. There are courageous people who would defend the right to speak what they are convinced about, even if stakes are invoked against them. I am one amongst them. I would not apologize nor succumb to any pressures.  Aprovechando su estancia aquí, Patricia Fernández de Lis (@pflis) pudo entrevistarle para Materia hace unos meses, y a raíz de esa entrevista supimos gracias a Patricia (¡gracias de nuevo!) que Sanal quería aprovechar su estancia temporal en Europa para realizar conferencias y actos públicos acerca de racionalismo y laicismo. No podíamos desaprovechar la oportunidad.\nSanal Edamaruku va a visitar España entre el 15 y el 19 de diciembre; en esta gira impartirá una serie de charlas sobre la separación entre la iglesia y el estado, la libertad de expresión y la supuesta ofensa de sentimientos religiosos. Pasará por Barcelona, Madrid, Granada y Gijón. Durante estas semanas tiene previsto visitar Reino Unido, Irlanda, Polonia, Suecia, Noruega o Alemania.\nLos eventos los organizan ARP – Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico, Círculo Escéptico y Europa Laica.

    "body": " Hoy, 24 de noviembre, muchas personas en todo el mundo celebramos el \"Día del Orgullo Primate\" para reivindicar nuestro origen evolutivo y por tanto nuestro parentesco con el resto de especies del mundo animal.\nEl Día del Orgullo Primate se celebra cada 24 de Noviembre porque en esta fecha sucedieron dos hechos relevantes muy relacionados. En 1859 Charles Darwin publicó El Origen de las Especies, y en 1974 se descubrió el fósil de Lucy, el más completo de un Australopithecus afarensis.\nMe sumo al manifiesto que promueve el blog Sin Dioses, promotor original de esta celebración:\nEl fantástico primer Árbol de la Vida, obra de Darwin Fuente: Wikimedia Commons - Public Domain    Nos sentimos orgullosos de ser miembros del orden de los primates. La inclusión en el grupo de los primates no es solo un aspecto taxonómico sino que revela también el parentesco evolutivo que tenemos con los demás primates. Nos sentimos orgullosos de \"descender de un simio\". No de una especie de simio actual, sino de un simio extinto, pero simio al fin y al cabo. No nos avergüenza nuestro origen evolutivo. Queremos hacer un reconocimiento al trabajo de los paleontólogos que han ayudado a descifrar nuestros orígenes evolutivos y deseamos que se siga desarrollando el trabajo de los paleontólogos, así como la divulgación de sus investigaciones. Queremos hacer un reconocimiento a todos los biólogos y conservacionistas que trabajan para ayudar a conservar las especies de primates actuales. Queremos declarar que los seres humanos no estamos separados de la naturaleza, sino que somos parte de la naturaleza, ya que nos relacionamos con ella en las interacciones ecológicas y por nuestro origen evolutivo. Manifestamos que nos sentimos orgullosos de ser homínidos y de que nuestros parientes más cercanos sean los simios africanos. La anatomía comparada y la genética nos muestra esta relación filogenética y tal hecho no nos hace menos como seres humanos. Queremos que el conocimiento de los orígenes humanos que nos revela la ciencia esté disponible en todas las escuelas y denunciamos el bloqueo que hacen de ello los grupos fundamentalistas religiosos. Manifestamos que la oposición que hacen los creacionistas respecto al parentesco de los humanos con los demás primates y de nuestra evolución es científicamente deshonesta y responde solamente a intereses doctrinales. Los creacionistas tienen derecho a creer lo que deseen pero no pueden pretender pasar por alto el testimonio fósil, ni del ADN, ni de hacer pasar sus convicciones religiosas como una explicación al mismo nivel de la ciencia.

De nuevo tendré la misión de cubrir el evento a través de @escepticos, el Twitter de ARP-SAPC (Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico), haré muchas fotos y posteriormente ayudaré a redactar la crónica para la revista El Escéptico de ARP.\nYa hablé el año pasado sobre el formato del evento, pero repasaré las características que definen al evento: En dos días escucharemos a 21 ponentes exponer sus ideas, y cada ponente hablará durante 21 minutos. Esta insistencia con el 21 es porque afirman que es el tiempo que el cerebro humano mantiene su atención al 100% (citation needed).\nTras mi experiencia del año pasado, debo advertir que lo mejor no viene durante los monólogos que se marca cada uno, sino en el debate posterior que se forma tras cada bloque temático de 3-4 charlas.\nDe la lista de ponentes para esta tercera edición destaco los siguientes: José Miguel Mulet, José Carlos Capel, Michael Shermer, Mario Alonso Puig, Pere Estupinyà, Nancy Segal, Isabel Behncke, Antonio Pellicer, Dennis Hong, Izaskun Chinchilla, Ferran Adrià, Jack Horner, Jim Adams, Lyly Rojas, Elsa Punset, Mikel Urmeneta, Ricard Huguet, Bernardo Kliksberg, Elena Adell, Ángela Posada-Swafford, Nieves Segovia, Jeremy Baka, Beatriz Lara y Luis Cacho.\nEntre todos ellos destaco a Dr. JM Mulet, que para eso es amigo, y por supuesto al Dr. Michael Shermer, que a sus hazañas sumará a partir de ahora deleitarnos el día 7 por la noche con una charla en Escépticos en el Pub Madrid, como ya comenté hace unos días.\nHay unos curiosos vídeos de presentación con varios de los ponentes, les dejo con los más conocidos por aquí:\nJosé Miguel Mulet    Michael Shermer    Jack Horner    ",

Ya hablé de este singular evento en el blog el año pasado, y si otros líos no lo impiden espero poder hablar aquí también del evento de este año.\nEntre otros interesantes ponentes, en El Ser Creativo podremos escuchar al magnífico Michael Shermer, que ya participó en 2011 en el evento hermano de El Ser Creativo en Puebla, México: la Ciudad de las Ideas. No podíamos desperdiciar su paso por aquí, y nos sentimos orgullosos de poder contar con él para una Edición Especial de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid.\nLa charla del Dr. Shermer será en inglés, tiene relación con su último libro publicado y por ello lleva por título From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies — How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths, y él mismo nos ha hecho el siguiente resumen:\n Synthesizing thirty years of research, Michael Shermer upends traditional thinking about how humans form beliefs about the world. Simply put, beliefs come first, and explanations for beliefs follow. \u0026nbsp;The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. Using sensory data that flow in through the senses, the brain naturally looks for and finds patterns —and then infuses those patterns with meaning, forming beliefs. Once beliefs are formed, our brains subconsciously seek out confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, accelerating the process of reinforcing them— and round and round the process goes in a positive feedback loop. Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. And ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not our beliefs match reality.  El siempre magnífico cartel, confeccionado de nuevo por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) a partir de una de las fotos habituales del propio ponente y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es el siguiente:\n  Podrán observar junto al logotipo de ARP-SAPC el propio de El Ser Creativo, ya que nos han proporcionado todas las facilidades posibles para llevar a cabo este evento (¡Gracias!).\nLa charla tendrá lugar el próximo Miércoles 7 de Noviembre de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 21:30. Al igual que sucedió en el Especial con James Randi y DJ Grothe, para poder controlar la comodidad y seguridad de los asistentes hemos puesto en marcha un sistema de venta de entradas para garantizar un aforo manejable. El precio de cada entrada es de CERO EUROS.\nLas entradas estarán disponibles desde el Viernes 26 de Octubre a las 12:00 en este enlace. Dado que para el especial de Randi \u0026amp; Grothe se agotaron en apenas veinte minutos, en el enlace de venta encontrarán también información sobre qué hacer si se quedan sin entradas, o qué les pedimos que consideren hacer si consiguen entradas pero después algo les impidiera venir ese día.\nPara concluir, les confirmamos que esta convocatoria no sustituye a la habitual charla mensual de Noviembre, que anunciaremos en los próximos días y que está programada para el día el 17 de Noviembre para esquivar los puentes que tenemos este año para comenzar el mes.\nNo se lo deben perder.\n",

Esta red es conocida como la DSN (Deep Space Network) y cuenta con dos estaciones más separadas entre sí unos 120 grados, el GDSCC en Goldstone (California) y el CDSCC en Camberra (Australia). De este modo los vehículos siempre tienen contacto con alguna estación en tierra independientemente de la rotación terrestre. A partir de los acuerdos alcanzados entre Estados Unidos y España, desde los años noventa el complejo es gestionado por la empresa pública INSA (Ingeniería y Servicios Aeroespaciales), dependiente de INTA, para el uso y disfrute de ambas agencias espaciales.\nLa conferencia tiene como tema presentar y analizar la próxima llegada y aterrizaje del rover Curiosity en Marte y la participación del CAB (Centro de Astrobiología del CSIC-INTA) en la misión MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) de la NASA. El ponente, Javier Gómez-Elvira, es Director del Centro de Astrobiología e Investigador Principal de REMS (Rover Environmental Monitoring Station), la estación ambiental a bordo del rover. Termino con un resumen de la charla a partir de la nota de prensa:\n La misión MSL de NASA, el Laboratorio científico de Marte, se encontrará exactamente dentro de 73 días en la superficie marciana. Desde su lanzamiento, el 26 de Noviembre, la nave se encuentra viajando por el espacio a una velocidad de 45.000 km/h. y tiene prevista su entrada en el campo gravitatorio de Marte la noche del 5 al 6 de Agosto. Marte es un planeta rocoso que tiene un enorme interés para la astrobiología, la ciencia que estudia el origen y evolución de la vida, ya que una de las preguntas que nos hacemos y que aún no ha obtenido respuesta es ¿alberga o albergó vida alguna vez nuestro vecino? El director del Centro de Astrobiología e Investigador Principal de REMS, Javier Gómez-Elvira, presentará en esta conferencia la ciencia que se quiere hacer, cómo es su diseño, y cómo nos estamos preparando para el momento del aterrizaje y el comienzo de los dos apasionantes años que nos esperan explorando Marte. REMS son las siglas en ingles de Rover Environmental Monitoring Station, la estación ambiental a bordo del rover Curiosity de la misión Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) de NASA. El Centro de Astrobiología ( CSIC-INTA) ha liderado el desarrollo, fabricación y calibración de REMS, en estrecha colaboración con un consorcio internacional. El equipo investigador ha estado formado por un grupo de unos cuarenta científicos e ingenieros, y su desarrollo ha durado más de siete años.  La imagen conceptual que ilustra el artículo es propiedad de NASA, JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) y Caltech (California Institute of Technology).

Porque amigos, el evento del día 11 con James Randi y D.J. Grothe es un extra, es de regalo, la convocatoria oficial ordinaria del Mayo se mantiene para el primer sábado de mes y la charla merece tremendamente la pena.\nEn esta edición José Manuel López Nicolás (@ScientiaJMLN); Doctor en Ciencias Químicas, Profesor Titular de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular de la Universidad de Murcia y autor del popular blog Scientia, nos hablará de lo que él llama Marketing pseudocientífico. En sus propias palabras:\n En esta charla se abordará el mal uso que distintos sectores empresariales como la industria alimentaria, nutracéutica, cosmética, etc. hacen de la Ciencia, utilizando el marketing científico para publicitar diferentes propiedades de sus productos que no se sostienen desde el punto de vista de la bioquímica, la biotecnología, la nutrición... ni del sentido común. Además, se hablará del papel que la divulgación científica, a través de los blogs e incluso de las redes sociales, puede desempeñar para aumentar el rigor científico en el etiquetado y la publicidad de los productos que consumimos diariamente.  La charla tendrá lugar el próximo Sábado 5 de Mayo de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30. Recuerdo que hemos eliminado el formulario de inscripción, pero pueden inscribirse para recibir todas las convocatorias por mail en esta lista de correo de avisos.\nLamentándolo muchísimo no podré acompañarles y escuchar a José Manuel, durante todo el sábado estaré en SkeptiCamp Alicante organizando un buen follón.\n",

Darío nos explicará cómo medir y controlar absolutamente todo lo que pasa en nuestro cuerpo, Mario por su parte nos hablará de robótica y su utilidad en el mar. Paso a describirles sus propuestas:\nDarío Pescador Albiach - Personas cualificadas, mitos y promesas Darío Pescador (@dariopes) es self-tracker, empresario, periodista científico y colaborador de la Revista Quo, entre otros medios. Fue coordinador web de Público.es. Es Ingeniero Técnico y algún día terminará las tres asignaturas de Ciencias Físicas que le quedan. O no. Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n La medida sistemática de la respuesta del cuerpo no es nueva. Es la forma tradicional en la que los entrenadores deportivos y los investigadores médicos trabajan. Pero ahora con un dispositivo móvil todo el mundo puede convertirse en su propio experimento para intentar mejorar su salud y su vida. Biofeedback, acelerómetros, control de los ciclos de sueño, ondas binaurales, entrenadores virtuales, registro de dietas, todo en el móvil y en tu bolsillo. El ser humano cuantificado está aquí. Es el momento de separar la publicidad de la ciencia.  Mario Vera Méndez - Algunas curiosidades debajo del mar Mario (@MarioVera88) entre el 2006 y el 2011 estudió Ingeniería y tuvo la oportunidad de colaborar en diversos programas de diseño y fabricación de mecánica y robótica marítima además de realizar prácticas en el varias empresas del sector. Actualmente estudio periodismo. Nos ha resumido la charla:\n En esta charla intentaré explicar que son los Rov y en que tareas tan complicadas nos suelen ayudar. Además, me gustaría contar algunas curiosidades sobre el “Prestige” que ocurrieron debajo del mar y otras curiosidades de ingeniería marítima.

Por un lado Héctor Castro nos dará una prometedora charla de introducción a la neurología y José Francisco García nos explicará qué es la cronobiología, un tema sorprendente y seguro que muy interesante. Paso a describirles sus propuestas:\nHéctor Castro Gómez - Neurología, la ciencia de vanguardia Héctor es estudiante de Biología y escéptico por naturaleza, Le encanta la ciencia y la divulgación. Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n Esta charla que pretende agradar tanto a gente ajena al tema como a gente que tiene idea del mismo. Intentaré abarcar un poco de historia de la neurología así como profundizar en temas de vanguardia como la regeneración neuronal y otros campos de reciente estudio  José Francisco García Martínez - El tiempo es una droga José Francisco (@wackman) es técnico en Diagnóstico Clínico, estudia biotecnología y es Community Manager de la Asociación de Biotecnología de Murcia (@BiotecMur).

Por un lado Antonio nos explicará, para aquellos que aún tengan dudas, de forma sencilla por qué los horóscopos son una chorrada. Nahum nos hablará sobre algunos aspectos de Marte que refuerzan el interés que todos tenemos sobre el planeta Rojo. Paso a describirles sus propuestas:\nAntonio Perez Verde - Horóscopos y otras formas de perder el tiempo Antonio (@aperezverde) es Ingeniero Técnico de Telecomunicaciones por la Universidad de Castilla la Mancha y BSc in Electronic Systems (Limerick Institute of Technology). Es desde niño astrónomo aficionado y desde 2007 se dedica profesionalmente a la divulgación y a la Astronomía con telescopios robóticos. Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n El método científico determina el protocolo a seguir para que un hecho sea considerado científicamente válido. En el caso de los horóscopos es fácilmente demostrable que no se adapta a este protocolo y que, aún siendo polvo de estrellas, el firmamento no marca nuestro destino.  Nahum Méndez Chazarra - Al fin y al cabo, tampoco fuimos tan distintos Nahum (@nchazarra) es estudiante de 5º de Geología en la Universidad de Granada. Dedica sus ratos libres a la divulgación de la ciencia a través de su blog Un geólogo en apuros y a través de los artículos publicados en el Journal of Feelsynapsis (@feelsynapsis). También es redactor en Hablando de Ciencia (@HdCiencia) y además participa como traductor en el proyecto HiTranslate de la Universidad de Arizona, con el que intentan acercar Marte al público terrestre. Nos ha resumido la charla:\n A través del uso de las distintas formas del relieve de Marte, intentaré acercar al público un planeta que hoy parece muy diferente pero que si miramos con una ventana temporal ligeramente distinta, y comparamos con la Tierra veremos que, al menos en un momento, fuimos muy parecidos.

    "body": " Entre las siglas que colecciono (como dicen algunos), dentro de las relacionadas con el pensamiento crítico además de pertenecer a ARP-SAPC (Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico) y Círculo Escéptico también soy socio de la JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation). Como socio de la JREF, y como no puedo estarme quieto, he insistido desde el principio en las actividades e intereses de la Fundación fuera de Estados Unidos y Reino Unido, dado el maravilloso esfuerzo que ya se hace en estos dos países. Por otro lado, ARP tuvo la amabilidad de ayudarme económicamente cuando supo de mis viajes a Manchester para la QED y a Nueva York para NECSS. En ellas he tenido ocasión de compartir lugar y conversación con gente bastante interesante, lamentablemente aún no he sacado tiempo para escribir las crónicas de ambos eventos pero lo haré y saldrán publicadas en la revista El Escéptico que edita ARP.\nDicho esto, cuando el Asombroso James Randi y el Magnífico D.J. Grothe contactaron hace varias semanas para avisar de que pasaban unas horas en Madrid se puso en marcha la maquinaria escéptica madrileña y, varios mails y varias conversaciones durante NECSS en Manhattan dieron como resultado la presencia de estas dos grandes figuras en la versión madrileña de Escépticos en el Pub, del que acabamos de publicar la convocatoria.\n  Ya saben que James Randi pasó de ser un reputado mago y escapista, a convertirse en uno de los escépticos más conocidos y reconocidos del mundo. Su trabajo durante años en la lucha contra las pseudociencias y los estafadores de todo tipo provocó en 1996 el nacimiento de la James Randi Educational Foundation, que trata de promover y perpetuar el esfuerzo de este asombroso señor. Habrán oído que Randi, a través de la JREF, ofrece desde hace muchísimos años un premio de un millón de dolares a quien demuestre tener, bajo condiciones claras, evidencias de cualquier poder paranormal o sobrenatural. El premio ha tenido varios pretendientes pero nadie ha logrado, ni logrará, reclamarlo.\nDouglas James Grothe es el actual Presidente de la James Randi Educational Foundation. Llegó al cargo por sus grandes contribuciones a revistas como Skeptical Inquirer, y a su incansable ánimo por charlar y debatir sobre todo tipo de temas relacionados con la ciencia. Mantiene el podcast For Good Reason en el que explora el enfoque científico y crítico de la actualidad diaria a través de entrevistas. Anteriormente presentó más de 200 episodios del podcast Point of Inquiry con un formato parecido.\nLos que me conocen saben que no soy muy de echarme flores, así que con la moderación habitual diré que estoy tremendamente contento por ver que va saliendo bien algo en lo que llevo tiempo trabajando. Es una alegría contenida por la inevitable contra-programación que esto hace a Street Alicante Science, evento en el que también colaboro especialmente con la organización de SkeptiCamp Alicante.\nOjo, mantenemos el lugar, Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6), pero cambiamos el día (Viernes 11 de Mayo) y la hora (20:00h).\nNos vemos allí.\n",

Les presento a Aaron y a Guillermo y paso a describirles sus propuestas:\nAarón Pedreño Sala - La Entomología Forense como herramienta contra el crimen Aarón es Licenciado en Biología en la Universidad de Alicante y actualmente está haciendo el Doctorado en el Departamento de Zoología y Antropología Física de la Universidad de Murcia. Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n La definición de la Entomología Forense y las aplicaciones en las investigaciones policiales y forenses en cuestiones como la estimación del intervalo postmortem, entomotoxicología y abusos y abandono de menores y personas con discapacidad.  Guillermo San Juan González - Ciencia y Policía Guillermo es Licenciado en Bioquímica por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid en el año 2000. Es Oficial de Policía, perito lofoscopista, ha participado en el Simposio de Avances en Toxicología Forense celebrado en Alicante en 2009 así como en el Curso sobre la Prueba Científica en el Proceso Penal: Aspectos procesales, técnicos y policiales celebrado en la Universidad de Alicante en 2010. Nos ha resumido la charla:\n La rápida modernización científica y tecnológica de las últimas décadas ha implicado un desarrollo en las diferentes disciplinas forenses empleadas diariamente en el trabajo policial, con el último fin de aportar conclusiones y procedimientos relacionados con su estudio pericial que sirvan como medio prueba ante el Juez. En esta ponencia explicaremos protocolos y técnicas empleadas por la Policía Científica como resultado de la Inspección Técnico Policial.

Por si le sobrase tiempo es además Vicepresidente de Círculo Escéptico (@cescept). Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n Se trata de incentivar el fomento del activismo dentro del escepticismo, proponiendo actividades y actitudes de fomento del pensamiento crítico.  Alicia Frías González - Alicia en el país de los escépticos Fernando también es el padre de Alicia, una simpática escéptica muy interesada por la ciencia y muy crítica con la pseudociencia. Cumplió seis años el 12 de abril, pero eso no le impide tener tremendamente afinado el kit detector de chorradas. Hemos conocido muchas de sus agudas apreciaciones a través de los relatos su padre, que nos ha resumido la charla:\n Alicia es una entusiasta de la ciencia, y a sus seis años recién cumplidos tiene un olfato infalible para detectar la pseudociencia. Nos contará sus impresiones sobre el conocimiento científico y los engaños del mundo de los adultos.

    "body": " Programé esta entrada hace algo menos de una semana desde Madrid. En estos momentos estoy en un tren camino de Washington a Nueva York, probablemente leyendo o durmiendo, pero la magia de la informática me permite contaros qué tengo pensado hacer este próximo fin de semana. La excusa para este viaje de 10 días por los Estados Unidos es que tengo la intención de participar en la próxima NECSS 2012 (Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism), que se celebra aquí en la Gran Manzana el 21 y 22 de Abril.\nNECSS (pronunciado nexus) es uno de los principales eventos de divulgación que se celebran cada año en Nueva York. Como ellos mismos indican, explora la intersección entre ciencia, escepticismo, medios de comunicación y sociedad con el propósito de promover un mundo más racional. NECSS está organizada por New York City Skeptics y la New England Skeptical Society, ambas entidades educativas sin ánimo de lucro.\nComo siempre últimamente, no ando sobrado de tiempo (vacaciones is not relax) para escribir largo y tendido sobre lo que espero encontrar, lo que me ha hecho dedicar un buen dineral en venir hasta aquí. Basta decir que llevo dos años con unas ganas tremendas de venir y por fin se han dado las circunstancias propicias. Por si os siguen faltando motivos, al igual que hice en la entrada que publiqué con motivo de mi asistencia a QED, pueden ver el programa previsto y la lista completa de ponentes. Os dejo aquí una pequeña selección de los ponentes y participantes más destacados para mi (aunque sobran las presentaciones, las resumo):\n James Randi. Qué se puede decir. PZ Myers. Autor del blog Pharyngula, el blog de contenido científico con más tráfico de Internet. George Hrab. Uno de los más recientes iconos musicales en el mundo escéptico y científico. Steven Novella. Imprescindible. Neurólogo clínico, director del inimitable podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, autor del blog NeuroLogica sobre neurociencia y pensamiento crítico. Rebecca Watson. Activista sobre escepticismo, ateísmo y feminismo. Líder y fundadora de Skepchick, también participa (y brilla) en The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe. D. J. Grothe. Escritor, mago y muchas otras cosas, desde hace unos años es Presidente de la JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation), a la que yo también pertenezco. Massimo Pigliucci y Julia Galef. Ambos son geniales, y se compenetran de maravilla como presentadores de uno de mis podcasts favoritos: Rationally Speaking. Massimo es Doctor en Genética, PhD en Botánica y PhD en Filosofía de la Ciencia. Ella es BA en Estadística e investigadora. Joe Nickell. Investigador y forense paranormal, el único en el mundo con dedicación a tiempo completo. Bob Novella, Jay Novella y Evan Bernstein. El resto de la fantástica cuadrilla de The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe.  El maravilloso podcast The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, además de ser el corazón del propio NECSS, grabará un episodio en directo con la participación de James Randi. Además, el sábado por la noche en una habitación de un hotel aún desconocido cercano a NECSS, grabarán un programa en privado para 20 afortunados entre los que me encuentro porque compré (creo) el último ticket disponible O:-)\nAl igual que sucedió para QED, ARP-SAPC (Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico) ha tenido la gentileza de designarme como su representante en NECSS y por ello tendré nuevamente el honor y la responsabilidad de ver, escuchar, charlar e intercambiar muchas ideas con nuestros colegas americanos. Todo esto se traducirá en artículos para la web y la revista El Escéptico que publica ARP. Para facilitar esta tarea, también al igual que en QED también los amables organizadores de NECSS me facilitarán entre otras cosas un pase especial de prensa.\nMe quedo sin tiempo para hablarles del resto del viaje, espero sacar un rato a la vuelta.\n",

    "body": "  (Esta entrada se publicó hace 24 horas en el blog de Street Alicante Science)  Quedan poco más de tres semanas para SkeptiCamp Alicante 2012, el evento abierto de divulgación que celebraremos el Sábado 5 de Mayo durante StAS Alicante.\nSi has llegado aquí sin saber qué es un SkeptiCamp, primero te conviene leer:\n La wiki oficial de SkeptiCamp la entrada de presentación de SkeptiCamp Alicante 2012 El anuncio de las dos primeras charlas  Hay varias charlas con flecos aún pendientes de concretar, pero ya podemos anunciar la tercera actividad confirmada:\nIsmael Pérez Fernández - El superpoder de la filosofía Ismael (@Hominidos) es Experto Universitario en Comunicación científica por la UNED, Director del grupo de cosmología de la Agrupación Astronómica de Madrid (AAM). Colabora como divulgador en la revista Dyna Ingeniería e Industria y actualmente es el director ejecutivo de ARP-SAPC (@escepticos). El tema del que nos viene a hablar le apasiona, tanto que acaba de abrir un blog sobre ello: El superpoder de la filosofía (@SPoderFilosofia). Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n Las hazañas de los superhéroes, su forma de vida, las decisiones a las que tiene que hacer frente etc. nos pueden servir de inspiración para pensar en temas que normalmente aparcamos a un lado mientras nos ocupamos de nuestros quehaceres diarios. Pero estos temas son importantes, y les deberíamos dedicar algo más de tiempo, no porque vayamos a encontrar respuestas perfectas sino porque posiblemente consigamos entender mejor las preguntas, lo cual no es poco, además, que pensar nunca está de más, a pesar de que últimamente no parezca estar de moda. En estos momentos difíciles, en estas horas oscuras en las que las circunstancias parecen conspirar para nublarnos el juicio, es más importante que nunca que hagamos un esfuerzo por tener un pensamiento crítico, es importante que hagamos uso de la razón, es importante que filosofemos. En definitiva, nos va a tocar ser un poco héroes, pues vamos a tener que reunir el valor suficiente para cuestionar aquello que no se cuestiona.  La asistencia a SkeptiCamp además de gratuita será totalmente abierta, no será necesario registrarse en la wiki oficial de SkeptiCamp Alicante 2012 aunque será muy recomendable (y de gran ayuda para la organización). Si hubiera problemas de aforo, premios (que los habrá), sorteos (que los habrá), etc. aquellos que se hayan registrado previamente tendrán prioridad.\nSeguimos esperando vuestras actividades, charlas y talleres. Recuerdo que se valorarán especialmente aquellas ponencias dedicadas a alguno de los temas estrella del StAS: Mar, Neurociencia y Astronomía. En lugar de registrarlas directamente en la wiki, las propuestas tendrán que ser enviadas por correo electrónico a skepticamp.stas@gmail.com utilizando una de las siguientes plantillas:\n Plantilla en formato abierto ODT (Aplicaciones que utilizan el formato OpenDocument) Plantilla para Word (Aplicaciones que utilizan el formato Microsoft Word) Plantilla en PDF (Aplicaciones que utilizan el formato PDF)  ¡Nos vemos en Alicante!\n",

    "body": "  (Esta entrada se publicó hace 24 horas en el blog de Street Alicante Science)  Queda poco más de un mes para que celebremos nuestro evento abierto de divulgación, SkeptiCamp Alicante 2012, concretamente será el Sábado 5 de Mayo, siendo posible que se prolongue el evento también al Viernes 4 si fuera necesario por la cantidad de actividades (y esperamos que lo sea).\nSi has llegado aquí sin saber qué es un SkeptiCamp, primero te conviene leer la entrada de presentación e incluso te recomiendo darte un paseo por la wiki oficial. Un SkeptiCamp es una conferencia informal sin ánimo de lucro, organizada por la comunidad para aprender y compartir en un entorno abierto. Cualquiera, aficionados o expertos, puede participar o dar una charla y aprovechar la oportunidad para darse a conocer y conocer gente. Las claves del modelo son muy sencillas: En primer lugar, cualquiera con ganas de aprender y compartir puede organizar. En segundo lugar, la base de la organización está en la colaboración, repartiendo el esfuerzo entre varias personas. Y en tercer lugar se fomenta, aunque sin exigir, que cada participante pueda ofrecer al resto una charla interactiva sobre un tema científico o de temática escéptica.\nUna vez situados, tengo el placer de anunciaros las dos primeras charlas, que además son ejemplos perfectos de lo que busca el modelo SkeptiCamp:\nJosé Carlos Vaqué Alcázar - El cáncer: mitos y verdades José Carlos es un estudiante de Medicina en 4º curso residente en Valencia y socio de Círculo Escéptico (@cescept). Entre los muchos temas relativos a la salud de los que podría hablarnos ha elegido el cáncer, un asunto tremendamente importante en el que todos debemos estar convenientemente informados. Él mismo nos resume la charla:\n Consistirá en explicar qué es el cáncer, cuáles son sus causas, cuáles son los tratamientos eficaces actualmente y todas aquellas concepciones erróneas que hay sobre estos temas y en las que tanto se apoyan las terapias alternativas.  José Ángel Carrión Rodrigo - Exoplanetas: Guía del Autoestopista Galáctico José Ángel (@exoplaneto) es aficionado a la Astronomía desde hace más de 15 años, posee un Máster en Astronomía y Astrofísica en la VIU (Universidad Valenciana Internacional) y es miembro de la asociación de aficionados CIDAM (Centro de Investigación y Divulgación Astronómica del Mediterráneo). Su trabajo Fin de Máster consistió en la observación y caracterización de planetas extrasolares y de eso quiere hablarnos. En sus propias palabras:\n Tan solo en 20 años hemos pasado de un desconocimiento total sobre la existencia de otros sistemas planetarios en el universo, a casi 800 exoplanetas detectados y 2300 candidatos. Ello ha sido posible gracias al desarrollo de tecnologías de observación que explico en la charla. Hoy tenemos estadística suficiente como para poner en cuestión algunos aspectos del modelo actual de formación planetaria, la repasamos y mostramos ejemplos relevantes.  La asistencia a SkeptiCamp además de gratuita será totalmente abierta, no será necesario registrarse en la wiki oficial de SkeptiCamp Alicante 2012 aunque será muy recomendable (y de gran ayuda para la organización).

    "body": " Como mucha gente estará de vacaciones el primer sábado de Abril (incluso aquellos que no sacamos muñecos a pasear), la edición de Abril de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid se retrasa una semana, ya está convocado oficialmente.\nJesús Rosino, divulgador sobre el cambio climático, traductor del genial Skeptical Science y autor de un libro sobre cambio climático, nos hablará de su especialidad en una charla que llevará por título El cambio climático antropogénico: ciencia vs. pseudociencia. En sus propias palabras:\n Veremos cuáles son los factores que determinan la temperatura media del planeta, cómo sabemos que se ha producido un calentamiento global y cómo sabemos que lo hemos causado nosotros. Cerraremos mencionando de manera más breve los efectos o consecuencias del calentamiento global, cómo nos afectarán y qué tipos de medidas pueden adoptarse. En cada uno de estos apartados iremos analizando algunos de los argumentos negacionistas más populares.  Es la segunda vez que se trata el asunto en EeeP Madrid y esta vez pretendemos dar un toque menos político y más científico. Tras haber hablado con el ponente estoy seguro de que será bastante esclarecedor y aportará luz sobre las dudas habituales. No deben faltar.\nEl cartel, confeccionado de nuevo por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es el siguiente.\n  La charla tendrá lugar el próximo 14 de abril de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30. Hemos eliminado el formulario de inscripción, pero pueden inscribirse para recibir todas las convocatorias por mail en esta lista de correo de avisos.\nLa charla me interesa mucho, pero nuevamente no podré acompañarles. Si en el pasado EeeP estuve en Manchester con motivo de la QEDCon en esta ocasión estaré en Washington para luego subir a Nueva York y asistir a NECSS (Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism) .\n",

    "body": " Hace un par de semanas me alegró el día saber que se está grabando y produciendo un documental sobre la vida del Asombroso James Randi. Este personaje, fundamental en el desarrollo y expansión del pensamiento crítico y la lucha contra las pseudociencias, merece todo tipo de homenajes, especialmente ahora que ya es bastante mayor aunque siga plenamente lúcido e hiperactivo.\nEl documental, titulado An Honest Liar (Un Mentiroso Honesto), está dirigido y producido por Justin Weinstein y Tyler Measom, que buscan donaciones e inversores para completar la producción. Por lo visto en el tráiler, cuenta con la participación y colaboración de una parte muy importante del colectivo escéptico mundial.\n   Según lo describen en la web (la traducción es mía):\n An Honest Liar profiles the life of famed magician turned professional skeptic James “The Amazing” Randi as he embarks on a series of public crusades to expose the world’s beloved psychics, mentalists, preachers, and faith healers with religious fervor. Along the way, the film will show how easily our perceptions can be fooled – by magicians, con artists, and even documentaries. Un Mentiroso Honesto perfila la vida del afamado mago que se convirtió en escéptico profesional James \"The Amazing\" Randi mientras se embarca en una serie de cruzadas públicas para exponer a los más famosos psíquicos, mentalistas, predicadores y curanderos. Por el camino, la película mostrará lo fácil que nuestras percepciones pueden ser engañadas – por magos, artistas del engaño e incluso documentales.  Habrá que estar atentos, el estreno está previsto para 2013.\n",

    "body": " Por fin saco un rato, con un mes de retraso, para hablar del evento Spring I/O 2012. A estas alturas lo fácil habría sido dejarlo estar, pero en mi empresa me han recordado que por algo me \"designaron\" como representante y autorizaron mi asistencia. Como primer paso para compartir lo vivido con mis compañeros (en forma de presentación si sacase tiempo), dejaré aquí un resumen de las notas que tomé. Omitiré en el blog las anotaciones más técnicas.\nSpring I/O logo  Spring I/O es un evento de gran nivel internacional organizado desde sus inicios aquí en Madrid por la comunidad de JavaHispano con el visto bueno, el apoyo y la colaboración de Spring Source. En esta ocasión más de 300 asistentes pudieron disfrutar de dos días completos, con dos tracks de charlas y un tercer track de talleres, sobre todo tipo de impresiones y experiencias alrededor principalmente de Spring, Groovy y Grails aunque muchas de las conclusiones son directamente aplicables a otros entornos y tecnologías.\nNo es posible estar en varios auditorios a la vez, y además tuve que ausentarme varias veces para volver al trabajo, por lo que comentaré brevemente las charlas que pude presenciar.\nAdrian Coyler - Application Development in the Cloud Era Adrian Coyler (@AdrianCoyler, CTO de Spring Source) fue el encargado de la charla de apertura y nos habló de la evolución de las arquitecturas de aplicaciones y cómo nos debemos adaptar al nuevo ecosistema. Los principales requisitos en la actualidad han cambiado a:\n Las plataformas móviles son lo primero, cada vez suponen un mayor porcentaje del tráfico online. Los servicios deben centrarse en el usuario, con independencia del terminal que utilice o el lugar en el que se encuentre. La información debe servirse y actualizarse en tiempo real.  En resumen, las aplicaciones deben seguir al usuario y proporcionarle en cada momento servicios en tiempo real con la mejor experiencia posible en cada uno de los dispositivos que utilice: ordenador, móvil, tablet, etc.\nSam Brannen - Spring 3.1 to 3.2 in a Nutshell Sam Brannen (@Sam_Brannen, colaborador activo de código para el Spring core y autor de varios libros sobre el framework) detalló de forma exhaustiva y bastante aburrida todas las novedades de la versión 3.2 (y 3.1) del framework Spring con respecto a versiones anteriores. Cabe destacar:\n Abstracción total por entornos. En la definición de cualquier bean de Spring se permite el uso de perfiles, tanto a nivel xml como componentes Java. Gracias a esto podríamos dar de alta directamente la configuración que queremos para desarrollo, testing, integración, producción, etc. Tremendamente útil. Mejoras para testing con Hibernate y JPA Mejoras en el soporte de la clase @Configuration. Cacheo declarativo mediante anotaciones @Cacheable y @CacheEvict.  Me arrepentí de haber entrado a esta charla en lugar de ir al taller de creación de plugins para Grails en menos de 10 minutos.\nPeter Ledbrook - Rapid development of enterprise web applications Peter Ledbrook (@PLedbrook. promociona y colabora con código a Grails) destacó los aspectos importantes que hacen a Grails una alternativa asequible y real para el desarrollo de aplicaciones. Destaco para los no iniciados:\n Construcción y control de dependencias mediante maven tanto de las aplicaciones como de los plugins Permite el uso de cualquier librería Java. Modelos de dominio configurables y mapeables mediante GORM, que por debajo utiliza Hibernate 3 con mayor peso de la filosofía más usada en Grails: Convención sobre configuración. Cualquier modelo se puede compartir mediante plugins. Gran cantidad de plugins para migración de Base de Datos e ingeniería inversa.  Una charla muy aconsejable. Si en algún momento está disponible el vídeo es recomendable.\nJames Ward - Running Spring Apps on the Cloud with Heroku James Ward (@_jamesward, principal desarrollador y evangelista de Heroku) dio una charla muy interesante e iluminadora de introducción a Heroku, una plataforma de servicios en la nube. Mediante sencillos comandos y combinación perfecta con la plataforma Git se puede mantener y desplegar aplicaciones en la nube. Nació en Junio de 2007 para dar soporte al lenguaje Ruby pero ya es compatible con otros lenguajes como Java, Scala, Clojure, Python o PHP.\nRob Harrop - Polyglot Messaging with RabbitMQ Rob Harrop (@RobertHarrop, autor de varios libros y colaborador activo de código para el Spring core) explicó mediante varios ejemplos sencillos la potencia y usabilidad del broker de mensajes RabbitMQ, implementación open source basada en el protocolo AMQP (no es JMS). Permite su uso simultáneo entre aplicaciones basadas en diferentes tecnologías y lenguajes de programación, siendo compatible con la mayor parte de ellos. Hizo una rápida demostración en vivo comunicando mediante RabbitMQ una aplicación Java y otra en Haskell.\nDavid Gómez García - Spring Data y MongoDB. Un caso de uso real David Gómez (@dgomezg, Ingeniero de Software y formador en Extrema Sistemas e instructor certificado de Spring Source) explicó uno de sus últimos proyectos y los motivos para adoptar MongoDB para la persistencia. En mi opinión se extendió demasiado sobre el proyecto en sí, pero fue un buen punto de partida para explicar los sistemas NoSQL y posteriormente la elección de MongoDB.\nPara justificar el uso de NoSQL comenzó explicando el Teorema de CAP según el cual es imposible para un sistema distribuido proporcionar simultáneamente las siguientes garantías: Consistencia (todos los nodos tienen la misma información), Disponibilidad (todas las peticiones tienen respuesta) y Tolerancia a la partición (el sistema debe seguir funcionando a pesar de alguna perdida de información puntual). Los sistemas NoSQL (Not Only SQL) se basan en el modelo de consistencia BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) en oposición al habitual ACID.\nEl uso de MongoDB se justificó por ser:\n Orientado a documentos. Almacenable en colecciones. Permite documentos heterogéneos. Utiliza un formato textual JSON que permite consultas sencillas con Javascript.  Sergi Almar - Securing your REST API with OAuth Sergi Almar (@SergiAlmar, miembro destacado de JavaHispano, organizador principal de Spring I/O junto a Abraham Otero e instructor certificado de Spring Source) combinó en su charla un poco de historia sobre seguridad en servicios REST y los protocolos de autorización que han desembocado en el estándar OAuth. Oauth, que se complementa con OpenID, se creó en 2007 basado en los ya existentes Flickr Auth de Flickr y AuthSub de Google, la seguridad está basada en el intercambio de un token y es totalmente orientada a recurso. Según Sergi Almar, los beneficios de OAuth son:\n Es un protocolo estándar. El propio usuario es quien controla y revoca el acceso. Ofrece la posibilidad de obtener estadísticas. Es implementado por muchos clientes open source.  Por otro lado, para él también hay inconvenientes:\n La documentación es muy mejorable. Es difícil de implementar. Existen variaciones del mismo concepto. No resuelve los ataques por fuerza bruta.  Más orientado a las jornadas terminó explicando el uso de OAuth mediante Spring Security, que desacopla totalmente OAuth y soporta ambas versiones OAuth 1.0 y 2.0.\nDomingo Suarez Torres - Grails, opción real y escalable para sitios web de alta carga Domingo Suarez (@domix, Ingeniero mexicano fundador de la comunidad SpringHispano) compartió con nosotros un tremendo caso de éxito desarrollado principalmente con software libre para una web de altísima carga (ClickOnero, la web de eCommerce más grande de Latinoamérica). La charla me dejó un gran sabor de boca, que mejoró tras otra ponencia posterior del tipo \"los problemas que tuve\" tan lamentable y aburrida que ni mencionaré. Además de Grails, Domingo y su equipo utilizaron para su proyecto:\n GORM, que les dejó tremendamente contentos aunque insistió en poner mucha atención al crear índices y al iterar grandes colecciones. Terracotta, para control de caché en sistemas distribuidos les funcionó de maravilla. Evita muchísimos accesos a Base de Datos y guarda directamente objetos Java, JSON, XML, entidades Hibernate, páginas completas o fragmentos de páginas. RabbitMQ, no les supuso ningún coste de administración y les permitió el procesamiento asíncrono de algunas consultas pesadas, envío de emails, etc. Mejoró ampliamente el rendimiento de la aplicación al liberar de una gran carga a los servidores orientados a clientes. MongoDB con Redis para almacenar y operar sobre estructuras de datos complejas. Ideal para estadísticas. ElasticSearch como motor de búsquedas complejas que funciona sobre Lucene, mejorado con el uso del plugin específico para Grails. JavaMelody para monitorizar todas las aplicaciones relacionadas.  Sin duda el año que vienen intentaré volver.\n",

    "body": "  (Entrada publicada originalmente en el blog de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica, asociación a la cual tengo el gusto y el honor de haber sido invitado a pertenecer)  Hoy 13 de Marzo tendrá lugar en Londres una cita que podría ser interesante para muchos de miembros de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica así como para los lectores de su blog. Se trata del evento Scientists and journalists need different things from science. Discuss organizado por The Royal Institution, en el que se pretende debatir sobre la función de ambos perfiles en torno a la ciencia, así como las relaciones que hay entre ellos y cómo mejorarlas.\nEn palabras de los organizadores (la traducción es mía):\n Recent debates on copy-checking of science-based articles in the media have exposed a gulf between what journalists do and what some scientists think journalists should do. How can these groups better-understand the work and intentions of the other? Does it matter? (Debates recientes sobre copias al comprobar la base científica de ciertos artículos en los medios de comunicación han puesto de manifiesto una brecha entre lo que los periodistas hacen y lo que algunos científicos piensan que los periodistas deben hacer. ¿Cómo pueden estos grupos comprender mejor el oficio y las intenciones del otro? ¿Importa?)  Para tener una base sobre la que debatir, Chris Chambers de la Universidad de Cardiff expondrá a su modo de ver cómo podrían los científicos hacerlo mejor. Ananyo Bhattacharya (@ananyo), editor jefe de la versión online de Nature, explicará lo mismo desde el punto de vista del periodista. Moderando el debate estará Alice Bell (@alicebell) del Imperial College London.\nLa opinión del Dr. Bhattacharya se pudo leer el pasado Martes en The Guardian, Science journalists should be asking questions and deflating exaggeration, un artículo muy interesante con bastante autocrítica. Al día siguiente se publicó en el mismo medio el artículo del Dr. Chambers para terminar de calentar el debate presencial posterior, Nine ways scientists can help improve science journalism.\n¿No sería fantástico (y útil) un evento así en Madrid?\n",

    "body": " Este fin de semana estaré en Manchester, Reino Unido, disfrutando como un enano en uno de los principales eventos a nivel mundial sobre pensamiento crítico y divulgación científica. Siento no haber sacado tiempo (a nadie le sorprenderá) para una entrada más elaborada, lo cierto es que tengo comprada la entrada, el vuelo y la habitación de hotel desde hace varios meses.\nQED (Question-Explore-Discover) es un maravilloso evento organizado por Greater Manchester Skeptics Society y Merseyside Skeptics Society. Siendo un congreso barato (sobretodo para lo que es habitual en UK) suele terminar con beneficios gracias a la generosidad de los participantes y asistentes. Al igual que el año pasado, que reunieron más de 5 mil libras, todos los beneficios irán a parar a dos organizaciones benéficas: la National Autistic Society (para ayuda a gente con autismo y Asperger) y Sense About Science (proporciona medios y argumentos científicos para temas que puedan estar en el debate público).\nEs difícil destacar algo entre un plantel de participantes tan asombroso. Tendré el placer de escuchar y (espero con algunos) charlar con gente de la talla de (por orden alfabético y dejando fuera a muchos):\n David Aaronovitch. Escritor, periodista y presentador, columnista habitual en The Times, The Independent, The Guardian o The Observer. Ha sido ponente en varios Escépticos en el Pub a lo largo del Reino Unido. Edzard Ernst. Fue el primer Catedrático de Medicinas Alternativas del mundo en la Universidad de Exeter y empezó su carrera en un hospital homeopático de Munich, pero desde hace unos años es el azote de todas las terapias alternativas. En 2008 publicó junto a Simon Singh el libro Trick or Treatment desmontando todas estas estafas. D.J. Grothe. Escritor, mago y muchas otras cosas, desde hace unos años es Presidente de la JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation), a la que yo también pertenezco. Robin Ince. Monologuista, actor y escritor, tremendamente popular por su programa de radio en la BBC The Infinite Monkey Cage junto a Brian Cox. Massimo Polidoro. Escritor, periodista y figura pública italiana. Es cofundador y cabeza visible de CICAP, una de las principales asociaciones escépticas en Italia. Fue además aprendiz a tiempo completo de James Randi sobre investigación paranormal. Richard Saunders. Presidente de Australian Skeptics y presentador de The Skeptic Zone. Richard Wiseman. Mago, psicólogo, profesor de Universidad, articulista y escritor de varios libros imprescindibles de temática escéptica.  Además, durante la gala nocturna del sábado se entregarán The Skeptics Awards 2011, los premios que otorga la revista británica The Skeptic.\nPara mi será un evento importante y especial. Además de escuchar formo parte del grupo de voluntarios que ayudarán a la organización en todo lo que necesite y participaré en varias actividades. La mayor parte detrás del telón y en algún caso delante, posiblemente en la mesa redonda sobre los Escépticos en el Pub a lo largo del Mundo que moderarán Michael Marshall y Sid Rodrigues.\nVuelvo otra vez más al Reino Unido, y ya son unas cuantas en un par de años, a un congreso de este tipo tras estar en la última TAM London y será el primero de varios eventos importantes a los que asistiré en pocas semanas. Detrás de la QED vendrá la NECSS (Northeast Conference on Science and Scepticism) en Nueva York y casi con toda seguridad estaré en el World Skeptics Congress en Berlín.\nPor todo esto, ARP-SAPC (Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico) ha tenido la gentileza de designarme como su representante en dichos eventos y por ello tendré el honor y la responsabilidad de ver, escuchar, charlar e intercambiar muchas ideas. Estas notas, ideas y reflexiones se convertirán entre otras cosas en artículos para la web y la revista El Escéptico que publica ARP.\nEspero que sirvan además como material de trabajo para que entre todos podamos hacer más y mejores eventos que nos hagan ser poco a poco más y mejores escépticos.\n",

En sus propias palabras:\n Repasaremos de una manera muy pedagógica qué es la propiedad intelectual, qué derechos la componen y qué papel juegan las entidades de gestión de las que la más conocida es la SGAE. Hablaremos de los juicios que la industria y las entidades de gestión han interpuesto contra los ciudadanos y cómo en la actualidad la acción política se está desarrollando en entornos regidos por este tipo de propiedad y qué están haciendo los hackers para evitarlo.

Promover e incentivar la actividad de creación de juegos de mesa en nuestro país. Defender los intereses de los creadores de juegos y promover el reconocimiento público de su actividad. Promover y apoyar iniciativas que contribuyan a dar a conocer el mundo de los juegos de mesa y la actividad de los autores. Incentivar y apoyar el desarrollo de la industria de los juegos de mesa en España. Promoción de los valores de amistad y solidaridad y de la función social de los juegos de mesa.  Con estos objetivos, además de otras iniciativas y actividades, llevamos varios meses buscando la ocasión de poder juntarnos y emplear un fin de semana completo a probar, compartir, criticar y disfrutar de los prototipos (en estados más o menos avanzados) que tienen en marcha los miembros de la asociación.

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " (Esta entrada se publicó hace 24 horas en el blog de Street Alicante Science)\nHasta hace poco la divulgación en este país se hacia para unos pocos y habitualmente también se originaba en unos pocos. Gracias al imparable desarrollo de Internet y la sociedad de la información, esto afortunadamente también se ha democratizado y vemos como día a día sigue en un crecimiento imparable hasta ahora e inimaginable hace unos años.\nQuizá no recordemos cómo era todo antes. Quizá nos parezca que se divulga de forma insuficiente (¡o hasta ineficiente!) pero la divulgación científica está en su mejor momento, gracias al esfuerzo de mucha gente y, cada vez más, al compromiso de muchas asociaciones e instituciones. Street Alicante Science es un ejemplo perfecto de lo que se puede conseguir hacer con bastante trabajo y muchísima ilusión.\nNo puedo ocultar que estas jornadas me gustan especialmente, encajan a la perfección en mi forma de entender cómo deben hacerse las cosas. El primer paso fue sacar la divulgación del ámbito más académico y acercarse a la gente. Hemos visto durante años ejemplos en cine, televisión, iniciativas puntuales de algunos museos, universidades,... El siguiente paso es la democratización absoluta, cualquier evento debe ser interactivo y bidireccional. Ya tenemos algunos ejemplos por todos conocidos, yo me siento orgulloso de participar en varios.\nLa Web 2.0 se define por varios elementos clave: información compartida, colaboración, interoperabilidad y tener al usuario como eje del diseño y la funcionalidad. Aplicando ese mismo criterio podríamos llamar Divulgación 2.0 a esta nueva forma de hacer las cosas, en la que se requiere, se promueve y se premia la participación de todo el mundo. El contenido es creado por la propia comunidad y se difunde por todos los medios posibles, para el beneficio común. Hay lugar y oportunidades para los más brillantes Doctores, para el investigador más puntero y para el educador más tenaz, pero también lo hay para cualquier ciudadano curioso, talentoso o inspirador. La Divulgación 2.0 no es aquella que se hace por Internet, aunque también, sino aquella que nos permite a todos participar y aportar.\nEscuchar una charla es tremendamente interesante y enriquecedor. Disfrutar de un documental puede cambiar nuestra perspectiva sobre algo. Preparando una actividad nos vemos obligados a profundizar mucho más en un tema que simplemente leyendo o escuchando sobre ello. Aprenderemos de la mejor forma posible y compartiremos esa preciada información con los demás. Habremos ganado y mejorado mucho, y conseguiremos que los demás también lo hagan. Es cosa de todos luchar contra el anumerismo y las pseudociencias.\nStreet Alicante Science ofrecerá divulgación de primer nivel, pero también te ofrece a ti (y a mi) la oportunidad de participar, ya sea nuestra idea muy modesta o tremendamente ambiciosa. Ya nos ha explicado Aurora la manera de hacerlo, es tan simple como hacer llegar tu propuesta a la organización, procurando que dicha propuesta sea bastante clara y concreta para facilitar que pueda encontrar hueco y (si procede) financiación.\nTengo el privilegio de poder colaborar con StAS, tú también puedes.\n",

    "body": " En Febrero tenemos doble sesión de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid. Ya tuvimos a Julián Palacios (Per Ardua ad Astra) hablando de Medicina futurista y a finales de mes contaremos con un extra especial.\nEugenio Manuel Fernández Aguilar (Ciencia en el XXI), que ya estuvo hablando de la conspiración lunar en la primera temporada de Escépticos en el Pub Madrid, nos hablará del fin del mundo, o siendo menos ambiciosos del fin de la humanidad. La charla lleva por título '10 formas de acabar con el mundo' y en boca del propio autor Se hará un breve recorrido por una selección de 10 formas de acabar con el mundo. No se trata de una charla sesuda y académica.\nPara acompañarle tendremos a Sacha Marquina con su espectáculo Escepticantos, del que ya disfrutamos en pequeñas dosis en el Congreso Antes del Fin del Mundo de l'Alfàs del Pi.\nEl cartel, confeccionado por Rinze (Las Penas del Agente Smith) y nuevamente basado en la plantilla de David Revilla, es tremendo.\n  La charla tendrá lugar el próximo 25 de febrero de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30.

    "body": "  (Entrada publicada originalmente en el blog de la Asociación Española de Comunicación Científica, asociación a la cual tengo el gusto y el honor de haber sido invitado a pertenecer)  Como algunos sin duda ya sabréis el pasado fin de semana se celebró SkeptiCamp Madrid 2012, por primera vez en un país de habla no inglesa, el primero por tanto en castellano y en España, cuya organización tuve el honor y el privilegio de coordinar y dirigir.\nUn SkeptiCamp es una conferencia informal sin ánimo de lucro, organizada por la comunidad y para la comunidad, con el objetivo claro de aprender y compartir en un entorno abierto. El modelo SkeptiCamp, que ya se ha utilizado para organizar 42 eventos, se basa en un conjunto de prácticas adaptadas del tremendamente exitoso modelo de conferencias BarCamp, que se inició en la comunidad tecnológica en 2005 y del que ya se han organizado varios cientos de BarCamps en más de 350 ciudades de todo el mundo.\nLas claves del modelo son muy sencillas:\n Se trata de eventos abiertos, es bienvenida la participación de cualquier persona con ganas de aprender y compartir. Se compensa la posible falta de experiencia como organizadores a través de la colaboración, repartiendo el esfuerzo entre varias personas. Se fomenta, aunque sin exigir, que cada participante pueda ofrecer al resto una actividad: charlas interactivas sobre un tema científico o de temática escéptica, talleres, etc. Todas las actividades son interactivas de principio a fin. Si alguien necesita una aclaración o tiene alguna duda puede preguntar en cualquier momento de la charla, buscando un debate razonado situando las preguntas en el mejor contexto posible.  Dado el carácter escéptico del evento, además de promover y vigilar que todos los participantes argumenten correctamente sin recurrir a falsedades o falacias lógicas, tras estas características subyace una idea esencial: Siempre debes estar preparado para citar tus fuentes ante cualquier afirmación que pueda ser puesta en duda.\nAdemás de los eventos de divulgación a los que estamos acostumbrados, en cualquier ciudad (grande o pequeña) encaja perfectamente la celebración de este tipo de eventos. Un evento que no incluya muchas actividades ni tenga mucho público será un éxito de todos modos para los asistentes. Mejor un evento pequeño, sin patrocinios, sin camisetas, etc. que no tener evento alguno.\nSkeptiCamp Madrid 2012 logo  Desde que se anunció la celebración del evento en Madrid la expectación ha sido grande y finalmente hemos contado con más de 90 inscritos y 15 charlas de temática muy heterogénea alrededor de la ciencia y el pensamiento crítico. Además de ser la entrada libre y gratuita, gracias a la generosa aportación de los patrocinadores (ARP Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico (@escepticos), la Asociación Círculo Escéptico (@cescept), el Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) (@CSICdivulga), la Editorial Laetoli (@ed_laetoli) y la Revista Quo (@QuoRevista)) hubo muchos y variados regalos y se pudo invitar al desayuno y a gran parte del precio de la comida a todos los asistentes.\nLas actividades, que además de emitirse en streamig fueron grabadas y serán publicadas en cuanto se realice el montaje entre el vídeo y las presentaciones, duraron desde las diez de la mañana hasta casi las nueve de la noche de forma ininterrumpida salvo breves descansos para reponer fuerzas, comer y hacer networking. Describo a continuación brevemente cada charla, incluyendo una videoconferencia en directo con SkeptiCamp Chicago que se celebró el mismo día:\n  Jorge J. Frías Perles   Y ahora... ¿Qué les cuento a mis alumnos? Tribulaciones escépticas en un aula de secundaria   Marisa Maliaño Toca   De mayor, quiero ser bacteria. Apta para todos los públicos, incluso los de ciencias   Julian Isla   Héroes y superpoderes. Curando una enfermedad rara   David Ruescas   Una perspectiva sobre la racionalidad. Racionalidad epistémica/teórica   Vicente Álvarez   Ciencia y paradojas: dos mundos incompatibles.

Y gasta más de lo necesario   Jesús Álvarez Ruiz   Y la fusión, ¿para cuándo?. Proyectos y Retos de una fuente de energía que nunca llega   José Luis Ferreira   El escepticismo en Economía. Trataremos de aplicar el kit del escéptico a la Economía   Mauricio-José Schwarz   Diez frases que no echaría de menos si no las vuelvo a oír. Esas cosas que por ser \"escépticos\" nos dicen una y otra vez   Chicago Skeptics   A global view on skepticism. We will join Chicago Skepticamp live via Skype to talk about the day's events and discuss interesting issues   Anónima   Lectura escéptica de noticias de patentes. Los ejemplos irán desde noticias sobre la difunta patente australiana de la rueda a la demostración \"in vivo\" del sujetador-mascarilla patentado, pasando por las noticias polémicas sobre patentes de medicamentos y sobre patentes relacionadas con las tecnologías de la información   Como coordinador y promotor en castellano de este peculiar modelo de eventos de divulgación espero ver su aplicación en distintas ciudades con tanto o más éxito que el cosechado en Madrid, ofrezco mis servicios y asesoramiento para ello.\nSi tienen la oportunidad de asistir, no lo duden y colaboren. Si no surge esa oportunidad, quizá tengan que empezar a pensar en organizar su propio SkeptiCamp.\n",

    "body": " Por algún extraño motivo no he hablado hasta ahora de uno de los proyectos a los que más tiempo de ocio (ocio puro) he dedicado en los últimos meses: la promoción en castellano a nivel global del modelo SkeptiCamp (lo que llamamos ESkeptiCamp) y en concreto la organización de SkeptiCamp Madrid 2012, que se llevará a cabo este próximo Sábado 28 de Enero en Madrid. Vayamos por partes.\n¿Qué es un SkeptiCamp? Los SkeptiCamps son conferencias informales sin ánimo de lucro, organizadas por la comunidad para aprender y compartir en un entorno abierto. Cualquiera, aficionados o expertos, puede participar o dar una charla y aprovechar la oportunidad para darse a conocer y conocer gente. SkeptiCamp es un modelo de evento que se basa en un conjunto de prácticas adaptadas del tremendamente exitoso modelo de conferencias BarCamp, que se inició en la comunidad tecnológica en 2005. Se han organizado muchos cientos de BarCamps en más de 350 ciudades de todo el mundo. El formato SkeptiCamp ya se ha celebrado en más de 40 ocasiones, siendo el evento de Madrid el primero en un país de lengua no inglesa, por tanto el primero en España y en castellano.\nLas claves del modelo son muy sencillas: En primer lugar, se trata de eventos abiertos, donde es bienvenida la participación de cualquier persona con ganas de aprender y compartir. En segundo lugar, se compensa la posible falta de experiencia como organizadores a través de la colaboración, repartiendo el esfuerzo entre varias personas. Y en tercer lugar se fomenta, aunque sin exigir, que cada participante pueda ofrecer al resto una actividad: charlas interactivas sobre un tema científico o de temática escéptica, talleres, etc.\n¿Cuál es el objetivo de un SkeptiCamp? Las motivaciones para organizar y participar en eventos abiertos son muy variadas en general. Asistir a charlas puede ser informativo y enriquecedor, pero estar sentado entre el público es una experiencia principalmente pasiva. Ambas cosas contribuyen al desarrollo de una persona como escéptico o divulgador, pero hay una diferencia abismal entre ellas. Preparando una presentación debemos sumergirnos en un tema de una forma mucho más profunda que simplemente leyendo sobre ello. Nos anticipamos a las preguntas y preparamos una serie de respuestas bien razonadas. En SkeptiCamp no hay turnos de ruegos y preguntas, se puede hablar y debatir durante toda la charla. De este modo también aprendemos a preguntar, responder, y escuchar otras respuestas con el beneficio del contexto adecuado. Los eventos abiertos se construyen enteramente en estos principios, haciendo hincapié en la participación y la interacción. Hacer que los ponentes respondan preguntas durante sus charlas no sirve únicamente para tener el mejor contexto posible para una pregunta sino también como mecanismo de control de calidad.\nSin embargo, tales oportunidades de aprendizaje son de poco valor si requieren de riesgo económico, no son asequibles, o son difíciles de organizar. Es aquí donde el modelo Barcamp brilla especialmente, que con practicas y recomendaciones muy sencillas permite fantásticos eventos al alcance de grupos de cualquier sitio. Se ha visto en lugares donde los eventos tradicionales son inexistentes y en ciudades con gran cantidad de eventos tradicionales de divulgación Un evento que no incluya muchas actividades ni tenga mucho público será un éxito de todos modos para los asistentes. Mejor un evento pequeño, sin patrocinios, sin camisetas, etc. que no tener evento alguno.\n¿Qué debe hacer un asistente en un SkeptiCamp? Estos eventos son (idealmente) gratuitos, el asistente paga su entrada a través de la participación activa en el evento. Antes del evento puede unirse a la organización, siempre hay algo que hacer y siempre es más sencillo y más divertido cuanta más gente esté dispuesta a ayudar. Además hará lo posible por organizar una charla o actividad y participará en las actividades de los demás. En cualquier caso, sea cual sea el nivel de participación, se recomienda encarecidamente que todo el mundo haga difusión del evento en todas las redes sociales posibles (sean físicas o virtuales).\nLa regla de Oro en un SkeptiCamp El modelo contempla una regla esencial dado el carácter escéptico del evento: Siempre debes estar preparado para citar tus fuentes ante cualquier afirmación que pueda ser puesta en duda. La intención de esta regla es simplemente permitir a otros evaluar la calidad de tu charla por ellos mismos. Y por supuesto, se promueve y vigila que todos los participantes argumenten correctamente sin recurrir a falacias lógicas.\n¿Qué implica la E de ESkeptiCamp? Se agrupan varias ideas. La letra E identifica a España a nivel internacional, pero en realidad es el prefijo ES el que hemos buscado, dado que define al idioma español en todo el mundo (es_ES, es_MX, es_AR, etc.). Además busca la analogía con Escéptico como traducción de Skeptic.\nSkeptiCamp Madrid 2012 SkeptiCamp Madrid 2012 logo  En España existe desde hace años una de las comunidades más activas y numerosas de apasionados de la ciencia y del escepticismo en general. Concretamente en Madrid el fenómeno es bastante fuerte y va en aumento y era cuestión de tiempo que adoptáramos este formato como propio. Hace varios meses se puso la idea sobre la mesa tras conversaciones entre Daniela Meli, Borja Robert y yo mismo, y no pudimos hacer otra cosa que ponernos manos a la obra. No importaba (sigue sin ser lo importante) si al final el evento convocaba a 30 o a 100 personas.\nSkeptiCamp Madrid nació como un anhelo de tres personas aunque cuando se hizo público y convocamos la primera reunión de búsqueda de organizadores en Junio de 2011 generó mucha curiosidad y ganas de colaborar en más de 25 personas. Finalmente hemos contado con un núcleo activo de unos 10-15 organizadores que amablemente decidió escogerme a mi como coordinador principal, tarea que he desempeñado junto a la de principal evangelizador en castellano del movimiento de eventos abiertos.\nDesde entonces han pasado muchas semanas, muchas reuniones regadas con mucha cerveza irlandesa y sobretodo muchos correos y llamadas de teléfono. A falta de escasas horas para su celebración, contamos con más de 85 personas inscritas que vendrán de muy lejos (Galicia, Málaga, Barcelona, Londres,...) para ofrecer 13 interesantes charlas al resto de asistentes. En este caso podría estar justificado el uso de 12+1 ya que se trata de doce charlas y una videoconferencia en vivo con SkeptiCamp Chicago 2012, que se celebra el mismo día al otro lado del Atlántico. Las charlas confirmadas, con una breve descripción, son:\n  Jorge J. Frías Perles   Y ahora... ¿Qué les cuento a mis alumnos? Tribulaciones escépticas en un aula de secundaria   Marisa Maliaño Toca   De mayor, quiero ser bacteria. Apta para todos los públicos, incluso los de ciencias   Julian Isla   Héroes y superpoderes.

    "body": " En cuestión de dos semanas vuelve Escépticos en el Pub Madrid, esta vez con un tema tremendamente interesante y apto para todo tipo de público interesado en la ciencia y la medicina, no exclusivamente escéptico. En parte por esta sensación (y deseo) hemos recuperado la sana costumbre de preparar el cartel del evento, servirá para darle una mejor difusión a la cita y nos permitirá captar lugareños curiosos.\n   La charla se titula Medicina-Ficción y será impartida por Julián Palacios, autor del recomendable blog Per Ardua ad Astra y residente de cardiología. Versará sobre la Medicina del futuro que ya tenemos aquí, en sus propias palabras:\n Todos pensamos en el médico como alguien con un fonendo al cuello, que te toca la tripa y receta pastillas. Pero la medicina actual también usa metales con memoria, bisturíes de ultrasonidos y turbinas que se meten en el corazón. Medicina ficción, todo esto y mucho más, en su hospital más cercano.  La charla tendrá lugar el próximo 4 de febrero de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30. Como siempre, para asistir conviene apuntarse en el formulario para preparar el evento.\nNo me despido sin agradecer a David Revilla las fantásticas plantillas que nos ha preparado, junto a un detallado tutorial paso a paso, para que podamos hacer los carteles de forma autosuficiente a la par que absurdamente bella.\n",

    "title": "The Chaos by Gerard Nolst Trenité",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " I've discovered through my dear friend Mónica a wonderful poem called The Chaos. I'm talking about between 146 and 274 funny and well thought verses (depending on the version) about English spelling and pronunciation singularities written by Gerard Nolst Trenité which appeared for the first time in 1920.\nI recommend as a splendid exercise that you attempt to read the entire poem aloud (aloud or do not try!). Everyone will get it wrong at some point for sure, but I hope you'll find it fun, challenging and educational. Hint! There is a partial phonetic version of The Chaos poem (both in English and American pronuntiation).\nI'm delighted to share with you a 1993-94 version from The English Spelling Society, the most complete version. As a standard practice, words whose spelling can lead to mispronunciation are shown in bold.\nDearest creature in creation Studying English pronunciation, I will teach you in my verse Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse. I will keep you, Susy, busy, Make your head with heat grow dizzy; Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear; Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer. Pray, console your loving poet, Make my coat look new, dear, sew it! 10 Just compare heart, hear and heard, Dies and diet, lord and word. Sword and sward, retain and Britain (Mind the latter how it's written). Made has not the sound of bade, Say - said, pay - paid, laid but plaid. Now I surely will not plague you With such words as vague and ague, But be careful how you speak, Say: gush, bush, steak, streak, break, bleak, 20 Previous, precious, fuchsia, via Recipe, pipe, studding-sail, choir; Woven, oven, how and low, Script, receipt, shoe, poem, toe. Say, expecting fraud and trickery: Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore, Branch, ranch, measles, topsails, aisles, Missiles, similes, reviles. Wholly, holly, signal, signing, Same, examining, but mining, 30 Scholar, vicar, and cigar, Solar, mica, war and far. From \"desire\": desirable - admirable from \"admire\", Lumber, plumber, bier, but brier, Topsham, brougham, renown, but known, Knowledge, done, lone, gone, none, tone, One, anemone, Balmoral, Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel. Gertrude, German, wind and wind, Beau, kind, kindred, queue, mankind, 40 Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather, Reading, Reading, heathen, heather. This phonetic labyrinth Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth. Have you ever yet endeavoured To pronounce revered and severed, Demon, lemon, ghoul, foul, soul, Peter, petrol and patrol? Billet does not end like ballet; Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. 50 Blood and flood are not like food, Nor is mould like should and would. Banquet is not nearly parquet, Which exactly rhymes with khaki. Discount, viscount, load and broad, Toward, to forward, to reward, Ricocheted and crocheting, croquet? Right! Your pronunciation's OK. Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve, Friend and fiend, alive and live. 60 Is your R correct in higher? Keats asserts it rhymes with Thalia. Hugh, but hug, and hood, but hoot, Buoyant, minute, but minute. Say abscission with precision, Now: position and transition; Would it tally with my rhyme If I mentioned paradigm? Twopence, threepence, tease are easy, But  cease, crease, grease and greasy? 70 Cornice, nice, valise, revise, Rabies, but lullabies. Of such puzzling words as nauseous, Rhyming well with cautious, tortious, You'll envelop lists, I hope, In a linen envelope. Would you like some more? You'll have it! Affidavit, David, davit. To abjure, to perjure. Sheik Does not sound like Czech but ache. 80 Liberty, library, heave and heaven, Rachel, loch, moustache, eleven. We say hallowed, but allowed, People, leopard, towed but vowed. Mark the difference, moreover, Between mover, plover, Dover. Leeches, breeches, wise, precise, Chalice, but police and lice, Camel, constable, unstable, Principle, disciple, label. 90 Petal, penal, and canal, Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal, Suit, suite, ruin. Circuit, conduit Rhyme with \"shirk it\" and \"beyond it\", But it is not hard to tell Why it's pall, mall, but Pall Mall. Muscle, muscular, gaol, iron, Timber, climber, bullion, lion, Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair, Senator, spectator, mayor, 100 Ivy, privy, famous; clamour Has the A of drachm and hammer. Pussy, hussy and possess, Desert, but desert, address. Golf, wolf, countenance, lieutenants Hoist in lieu of flags left pennants. Courier, courtier, tomb, bomb, comb, Cow, but Cowper, some and home. \" Solder, soldier! Blood is thicker\", Quoth he, \"than liqueur or liquor\", 110 Making, it is sad but true, In bravado, much ado. Stranger does not rhyme with anger, Neither does devour with clangour. Pilot, pivot, gaunt, but aunt, Font, front, wont, want, grand and grant. Arsenic, specific, scenic, Relic, rhetoric, hygienic. Gooseberry, goose, and close, but close, Paradise, rise, rose, and dose. 120 Say inveigh, neigh, but inveigle, Make the latter rhyme with eagle. Mind! Meandering but mean, Valentine and magazine. And I bet you, dear, a penny, You say mani-(fold) like many, Which is wrong. Say rapier, pier, Tier (one who ties), but tier. Arch, archangel; pray, does erring Rhyme with herring or with stirring? 130 Prison, bison, treasure trove, Treason, hover, cover, cove, Perseverance, severance. Ribald Rhymes (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled. Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw, Lien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw. Don't be down, my own, but rough it, And distinguish buffet, buffet; Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon, Worcester, Boleyn, to impugn. 140 Say in sounds correct and sterling Hearse, hear, hearken, year and yearling. Evil, devil, mezzotint, Mind the z! (A gentle hint.) Now you need not pay attention To such sounds as I don't mention, Sounds like pores, pause, pours and paws, Rhyming with the pronoun yours; Nor are proper names included, Though I often heard, as you did, 150 Funny rhymes to unicorn, Yes, you know them, Vaughan and Strachan. No, my maiden, coy and comely, I don't want to speak of Cholmondeley. No. Yet Froude compared with proud Is no better than McLeod. But mind trivial and vial, Tripod, menial, denial, Troll and trolley, realm and ream, Schedule, mischief, schism, and scheme. 160 Argil, gill, Argyll, gill. Surely May be made to rhyme with Raleigh, But you're not supposed to say Piquet rhymes with sobriquet. Had this invalid invalid Worthless documents? How pallid, How uncouth he, couchant, looked, When for Portsmouth I had booked! Zeus, Thebes, Thales, Aphrodite, Paramour, enamoured, flighty, 170 Episodes, antipodes, Acquiesce, and obsequies. Please don't monkey with the geyser, Don't peel 'taters with my razor, Rather say in accents pure: Nature, stature and mature. Pious, impious, limb, climb, glumly, Worsted, worsted, crumbly, dumbly, Conquer, conquest, vase, phase, fan, Wan, sedan and artisan. 180 The TH will surely trouble you More than R, CH or W. Say then these phonetic gems: Thomas, thyme, Theresa, Thames. Thompson, Chatham, Waltham, Streatham, There are more but I forget 'em - Wait! I've got it: Anthony, Lighten your anxiety. The archaic word albeit Does not rhyme with eight - you see it; 190 With and forthwith, one has voice, One has not, you make your choice. Shoes, goes, does [1]. Now first say: finger; Then say: singer, ginger, linger. Real, zeal, mauve, gauze and gauge, Marriage, foliage, mirage, age, Hero, heron, query, very, Parry, tarry, fury, bury, Dost, lost, post, and doth, cloth, loth, Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath. 200 Faugh, oppugnant, keen oppugners, Bowing, bowing, banjo- tuners Holm you know, but noes, canoes, Puisne, truism, use, to use? Though the difference seems little, We say actual, but victual, Seat, sweat, chaste, caste, Leigh, eight, height, Put, nut, granite, and unite Reefer does not rhyme with deafer, Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer. 210 Dull, bull, Geoffrey, George, ate, late, Hint, pint, senate, but sedate. Gaelic, Arabic, pacific, Science, conscience, scientific; Tour, but our, dour, succour, four, Gas, alas, and Arkansas. Say manoeuvre, yacht and vomit, Next omit, which differs from it Bona fide, alibi Gyrate, dowry and awry. 220 Sea, idea, guinea, area, Psalm, Maria, but malaria.

Once, but nonce, toll, doll, but roll, Polish, Polish, poll and poll. 260 Pronunciation - think of Psyche! - Is a paling, stout and spiky. Won't it make you lose your wits Writing groats and saying 'grits'? It's a dark abyss or tunnel Strewn with stones like rowlock, gunwale, Islington, and Isle of Wight, Housewife, verdict and indict. Don't you think so, reader, rather, Saying lather, bather, father? 270 Finally, which rhymes with enough, Though, through, bough, cough, hough, sough, tough?? Hiccough has the sound of sup... My advice is: GIVE IT UP! [1] No, you're wrong. This is the plural of doe.  ",

Tiene bastante experiencia en charlas de nutrición en empresas e incluso ha participado en varios programas de radio y televisión.\nEsperamos que pueda aclarar algunas ideas equivocadas que puede tener la gente. Resulta esperanzador, tengamos previsto o no recurrir a servicios de este tipo, saber que no todas las empresas del sector trabajan con métodos y tratamientos anticientíficos (o cuanto menos pseudocientíficos). Aparentemente cuanto más popular es una dieta, más debería hacer sonar nuestras alarmas. El dinero fácil, invirtiendo en marketing en lugar de en investigación, es muy tentador para muchos profesionales.\nComo es habitual, la charla tendrá lugar el próximo 14 de enero de 2012 en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30. Como siempre, para asistir conviene apuntarse en el formulario para preparar el evento.\nAllí nos vemos.\n",

    "body": " Este año he jugado mucho y a muchos juegos, tantos que apenas en algunos he repetido más de 2-3 veces. Como catalogador obsesivo y compulsivo tengo las cifras más o menos exactas gracias a Board Game Geek y su fantástica aplicación para Android.\nPlan para la Nochevieja 2011\nSource: My own pictures - CC BY-NC-SA  Paso directamente al resumen de las cifras. He jugado 164 partidas a 71 juegos diferentes, considerando que a 39 de ellos sólo jugué una única vez. Los doce juegos a los que más he jugado en 2011 son (ordenados de más a menos partidas):\n Ra Gloria a Rome Passing Shot Piko Piko Coloretto Guillotine Fauna La Resistencia La Isla Prohibida Jungle Speed Mr. Jack San Juan  No necesariamente he jugado más a los que más me gustan, simplemente hay juegos que ven mesa con más facilidad que otros en parte por su corta duración, por ejemplo el Piko Piko o el Jungle Speed. Me gustaría haber jugado mucho más a otros como Die Macher, Descent o Agricola, pero la duración y el tipo de jugadores necesarios lo hacen más complicado.\nAdemás, este año ha sido especialmente evangelizador y he tenido innumerables tardes de juegos con neófitos. Espero que lo sembrado en 2011 en ese sentido se transforme en 2012 en más y sobretodo mejores sesiones de juego.\nComo ejemplo no especialmente representativo, junto a esta entrada pueden ver una foto que saqué de la pila de juegos que teníamos para esta pasada Nochevieja: Race for the Galaxy, Carcassonne The Castle, Twilight Struggle, Agricola, Talisman y Fauna.\n",

Para que entiendan su necesidad, a pesar de que contamos con servicios gratuitos de mapas a patadas, es perfecto el párrafo de introducción a la Wiki del proyecto.\n  OpenStreetMap creates and provides free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. (OpenStreetMap es un proyecto dirigido expresamente a crear y ofrecer datos geográficos libres, tales como planos de calles, a cualquiera que los desee. El proyecto comenzó debido a que muchos mapas que se cree que son libres, tienen en realidad restricciones legales o técnicas para su uso, lo cual evita que cualquier persona los pueda utilizar de forma creativa, productiva o inesperada.)  Al igual que considero fundamental gozar de datos libres para contenidos por ejemplo enciclopédicos a través de servicios como Wikipedia, es esencial disponer de la misma libertad para los datos geográficos. Gracias al trabajo de muchos desarrolladores es muy sencillo colaborar, incluso entretenido, y se puede ayudar aunque sea con trazados muy básicos hasta en lugares donde no hayamos estado nunca.\nMenciono todo esto para ponerles a continuación un vídeo que muestra todas las ediciones hechas en el proyecto OpenStreetMap durante 2011. Las inserciones y modificaciones se muestran con flashes de color blanco, mientras las ediciones acumuladas se ven en morado. Sirve para comprender perfectamente la fuerza del proyecto, la implantación que tiene en Europa (pero no únicamente), y el gran trabajo que queda por hacer.\n   La animación ha sido realizada por Derick Rethans (que dispone de un interesante repositorio de herramientas para OpenStreetMap) enteramente a base de software open source. A partir de los datos crudos en XML generó imágenes con las ediciones (4 imágenes por día), dichas imágenes las proyectó sobre un mapa y para terminar lo renderizó todo en 3D con la herramienta Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray).

    "title": "God is not Great by Christopher Hitchens",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " This is going to be my first review in English. Don't Panic! As I recently only read and watch both TV series and films in English (usually without subs) seems to me the perfect way to express ideas and concepts from the books, as well as a way to improve my skills. Please help me notice any inconvenience or mistake.\nI've been constantly thinking about this post since I finished the book almost two months ago. In this time lapse Mr. Hitchens died, with the subsequent hard time for us his followers. Embarrassingly I didn't have the time and/or strength to write about it, I found it difficult to write something different than what many others wrote. Although it was not a surprise for anyone, his death truly made me very sad and angry.\nChristopher Hitchens - God is not Great  God is not Great is a 2007 book from Christopher Hitchens. In this book he made a fierce and sincere apology against religion, or at least against organized religion. Focusing on the Abrahamic religions, the book contains a perfectly documented collection of facts, personal anecdotes and well chosen arguments. In each of the nineteen chapters the author explains (for example) how religion kills, how do we know some metaphysical claims of religion are false, the lies behind intelligent design, and how some religions have ended in the past.\nIn Chapter Two, Religion Kills, he described common irrationally violent situations in many cities (Belfast, Beirut, Bombay, Belgrade, Bethlehem or Baghdad) easily attributed to religion. He also wrote about the 1989 fatwa against his friend Salman Rushdie and the crazy actions driven by the US after the September 11 attacks, as examples where religious leaders pursued, allowed and justified big massacres.\nIn Chapter Four, A Note On Health, he reminds us of some big confrontations between medicine and religion: some vaccines, condoms, the Jewish circumcision and the female genital mutilation rituals, and the pursuing and punishment of homosexuality.\nChapter Five, The Metaphysical Claims of Religion Are False, where Mr. Hitchens explains the difference between the knowledge of the world today and when some religions where founded. He claims that the necessary leap of faith needs to be repeated, and it turns harder to take the more it is taken.\nIn Chapter Nine, The Koran Is Borrowed From Both Jewish and Christian Myths he examines the religion of Islam and its holy book, the Koran, asserting that it was not supernatural and simply was a compendium of other religious texts and sayings.\nChapter Thirteen, Does Religion Make People Behave Better?, explains how non-religious people stand and pursue moral causes with at least as much strength and clearness as religious people. He also notes many issues of misbehavior in religious leaders.\nIn Chapter Fourteen, There Is No 'Eastern' Solution, he blames Asiatic religions as Buddhism and Hinduism with similar sins and problems: the violence, the unverifiable assumptions, the unhealthy manners and rituals, etc.\nChapter Fifteen, Religion As An Original Sin, where he declares that there are several ways in which religion is not just amoral but positively immoral, being the faults found not in its adherents but in its original precepts. These include:\n Presenting a false picture of the world to the credulous The doctrine of blood sacrifice The doctrine of atonement The doctrine of eternal reward or eternal punishment The imposition of impossible tasks or rules  And Finally Chapter Nineteen, In Conclusion: The Need for a New Enlightenment, where he argues that the human race no longer needs religion, to the point that underestimating religion will improve mankind, and will boost the progress of civilization. He ends asking atheists to fight for a religion-free society.\nSome of the commonly selected quotes are:\n Organized religion is violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children. Religion spoke its last intelligible or noble or inspiring words a long time ago. I can think of a handful of priests and bishops and rabbis and imams who have put humanity ahead of their own sect or creed. History gives us many other such examples, which I am going to discuss later on. But this is a compliment to humanism, not to religion. At least two major and established religions, with millions of adherents in Africa, believe that the cure is much worse than the disease. They also harbor the belief that the AIDS plague is in some sense a verdict from heaven upon sexual deviance--in particular upon homosexuality. In Ireland alone--once an unquestioning disciple of Holy Mother Church--it is not estimated that the unmolested children of religious schools were very probably the minority. One must state it plainly. Religion comes from the period of human prehistory where nobody--not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made from atoms--had the smallest idea what was going on. It comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species, and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge (as well as for comfort, reassurance, and other infantile needs). Today the least educated of my children knows much more about the natural order than any of the founders of religion and one would like to think--though the connection is not a fully demonstrable one--that this is why they seem so uninterested in sending fellow humans to hell. Conceivably, some readers of these pages will be shocked to learn of the existence of Hindu and Buddhist murderers and sadists. Perhaps they dimly imagine that contemplative easterners, devoted to vegetarian diets and meditative routines, are immune to such temptations? If religious instruction were not allowed until the child had attained the age of reason, we would be living in a quite different world. Philosophy begins where religion ends, just as by analogy chemistry begins where alchemy runs out, and astronomy takes the place of astrology. Religion has run out of justifications. Thanks to the telescope and the microscope, it no longer offers and explanation of anything important.   Mr. Hitchens was an English (also American since 2007) journalist, author and polemicist, in the wider meaning of the expression. He was considered one of the main intellectuals of the world, and was clearly identified as a Pope (in the techie way) in the atheist movement. After a brilliant career with a lot of polemic confrontations with people as Mother Teresa (Hell's Angel documentary) or Bill Clinton (No One Left to Lie To), and demolishing debates against figures like Tony Blair, he faced some serious health issues due to an oesophageal cancer. On 15 December 2011, Hitchens died from pneumonia, as a complication of this cancer.\nI'm not used to write bios in this blog, but if that moment comes surely he is going to be among the firsts to appear.\n",

    "body": " Recupero la no siempre valorada (y escasamente frecuente en mi caso) costumbre de hacer una crónica del unboxing de un pedido. En esta ocasión se trata de narrar los hechos acontecidos desde que se realizó el pedido en el pasado mes de Julio hasta hoy. Todos ustedes deberían conocer la tira cómica de XKCD, y si no es así pulsen Alt-F4 en este momento. No me detendré en ello.\nEmpecemos con las tribulaciones, ya que se preguntarán cómo es posible que el pedido llegue ahora si se hizo en Julio, y la historia es curiosa. En su momento se envió pero no llegó nunca a su destino, yo dejé pasar un tiempo prudencial medible en semanas y tras ese tiempo prudencial olvidé por completo el pedido (a pesar de haberlo pagado). A finales de Noviembre sentí de nuevo el impulso de comprarme la corbata de XKCD y recordé todo. Contacté con la magnífica gente de la tienda y por fortuna tras comprobar que el tracking del otro pedido se pierde en el limbo se ofrecen inmediatamente a reenviar el pedido o devolverme íntegramente el dinero. Mi afán por conseguir los productos solicitados me obligó a escoger la primera opción.\nEn estas que hace dos días contacta conmigo la gente de FedEx: El pedido está en proceso de regularización aduanera. Me solicitan información: NIF / CIF del importador, Dirección fiscal del importador, Número de Teléfono y Fax de contacto y descripción de la mercancía. Les aporto dicha información con gran tentación de ocultar que contiene textiles (principal problema aduanero con Estados Unidos según tengo entendido) y menos de 12 horas después ya he recibido el pedido... con sorpresa:\n   La sorpresa es un recargo de 78,38 euros con el siguiente desglose:\n   Esto evidentemente no es achacable a XKCD, creo que su envoltorio y comportamiento es impecable. Se podría reflexionar largo y tendido sobre el hecho de pagar IVA por unas camisetas compradas en Estados Unidos cuando me paso el día haciendo todo tipo de pagos y compras por medio mundo. En un pedido de 173 euros pagar en aduanas otros casi 80 no hace ninguna gracia.\nTras el susto del impuesto aleatorio revolucionario me encuentro con todo perfectamente embalado y doblado:\n   El contenido de la caja es el siguiente:\n   No se asusten, no todo es para mi (mío es sólo el 54% del pedido). En detalle:\n xkcd: volume 0, el primer libro recopilatorio de xkcd La corbata de xkcd, \"añade +5 a tu carisma.\" Pack de 10 Pines de xkcd Polo 'Hat Guy' Camiseta 'Stand Back (Science)', variante de la tira #208 Camiseta 'Useless', basada en la tira #55 Camiseta 'Correlation', con la genial tira #552 Camiseta 'Compiling', \"incrementa tus habilidades de programación y lucha con espadas\" Camiseta 'Science', en homenaje al método científico con una gráfica sobre los datos del COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer - Explorador del Fondo Cósmico)  Camiseta 'Sudo', con la histórica tira #149 La alfombrilla de ratón de xkcd  En definitiva, hacer un pedido a una tienda online de Estados Unidos sigue teniendo ciertas dosis de intriga y terror.\n",

    "body": " (De ahora en adelante escribiré algunas de mis entradas en inglés, como simple entrenamiento y entretenimiento. A nadie le debería sorprender. Por favor, comuniquen cualquier error o incorrección)\nOne of the main (and marvellous) things about BoardGameGeek (BGG) is its Community. The entire website is built upon them, thanks to them. That's why I'm part of it, I love it, help it grow, and cheerfully support it each year.\nFor those who doesn't know BGG yet, it is the biggest and most valuable games database and social network. There you'll find all the important info about a game enriched with all kinds of user contents, from hints, play guides, rule translations (if needed), photos, buy\u0026amp;sell info, recommendations, etc.\nThat itself is useful for any gamer, but for the obsessive cataloguers like me it also helps me track all my games, previously owned games, wishlist, private info, acquisition details, notes,... It's priceless for me.\nNow I've added another marvellous experience. I signed in for this year BoardGameGeek Secret Santa, a massive worldwide gift exchange between more than two thousand people from the BGG Community. I sent a game about a week ago and today I've received a package from my secret (and generous) friend.\n   The main rules are simple:\n Getting a present is fun, but Secret Santa is all about the giving. Prepare yourself to any disappointing gift, although it'll be rare. You must make sure to update your wishlist (not want list) of games. The more and diverse games you have on your list, the easier it is for your Secret Santa to fulfil your needs and wishes. It's an International Secret Santa, everyone is welcome, but you'll have the option (not recommended) to pick which countries you are willing to ship to. Most importantly, have fun!  My Secret Santa reasoned that the second board game in order of preference in my wishlist was a good choice (a great choice, I'll add) but not enough for him/her, so I have also received the first expansion of the game. I can remove from my wishlist Race for the Galaxy and Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm, both from Tom Lehmann.\n   Thanks a lot!!\n",

    "body": " Como Tesorero de la Asociación Ludo (Asociación de Creadores de Juegos de Mesa), publico el siguiente manifiesto y con ello me sumo a esta iniciativa que pretende un mayor reconocimiento al trabajo de todos los creadores que participan en un juego de mesa:\n Ludo (Asociación de Creadores de Juegos de Mesa) se constituyó en España a principios de 2011 con el principal objetivo de compartir conocimientos y experiencias para el impulso y reconocimiento de autores, diseñadores gráficos, ilustradores y traductores en el ámbito lúdico. Asociación Ludo  Con esta premisa por bandera e inspirados por el profundo respeto que tenemos todos los miembros de Ludo por el juego de mesa como objeto artístico y obra cultural, no podemos menos que secundar el movimiento iniciado aquél mítico 2 de febrero de 1988 en la cafetería de la Feria Internacional del Juguete de Núremberg por los trece autores que firmaron en un posavasos un breve escrito que contribuyó al merecido reconocimiento posterior de la autoría de los juegos de mesa: “Ninguno de nosotros dará un juego a una editorial, si nuestro nombre no está en la portada de la caja”, rezaba aquel manifiesto. La SAZ (Spiele-Autoren-Zunft), fundada en Alemania en 1991, durante este 2011 ha continuado con este compromiso promoviendo internacionalmente el movimiento conceptual de: Los juegos también tienen autores. Ludo quiere dar un paso más en esta dirección mediante este manifiesto. Entendemos el juego de mesa como una obra cultural donde debe ser condición esencial el respeto por todos aquellos que han contribuido a su creación, por lo que instamos a todas las editoriales a reconocer su trabajo y esfuerzo acreditando el mismo como norma de deferencia y buena conducta, tal y como ocurre en el resto de disciplinas artísticas equiparables. Así pues, desde Ludo invitamos a todas las editoriales nacionales e internacionales a acreditar a aquellas personas que, junto a la editorial, han contribuido a la creación de un juego de mesa. Consideramos que en la cubierta de la caja debería figurar el nombre del autor y, si el editor lo considera adecuado, el nombre del artista y/o su firma. Además, en la parte trasera deberían ir acreditados el autor, el ilustrador y el resto de responsables de la imagen final del juego. Finalmente, en el apartado de créditos del reglamento deberían aparecer, además de los anteriores, todos los demás involucrados en el proceso de creación del juego (redactores, traductores, probadores, etc…).

    "title": "Desfase en la isla de Pitcairn",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Hace más de siete años publiqué en el blog varias entradas sobre la Isla de Pitcairn. Se trata de una curiosa isla en la polinesia francesa de unos 5 kilómetros cuadrados situada a 36 horas en barco del aeropuerto más cercano y con una población estimada para 2011 de 60 personas. En su momento llegó a este blog porque una policía británica pasó por esta isla, y charlando con las mujeres nativas registró más de 100 denuncias por acoso sexual referidas contra siete hombres, más de la mitad de la población masculina de la isla en aquel momento. Más tarde volvió al blog porque seis de los siete acusados fueron condenados aunque inicialmente se libraban de la prisión y ya en 2006 se supo que finalmente irían a prisión, en una cárcel construida en la propia isla.\nPor un tema bien diferente, aunque igual de chanante, hoy me encontré de nuevo con Pitcairn y sus habitantes. Leo en Skepticblog la entrada The Pitcairn Island Calendar Mistery, escrita por Brian Dunning y cito porque su introducción es inmejorable:\n The year was 1808, and men of the American trading ship Topaz landed on Pitcairn Island, thus becoming the first to contact the colony founded by the infamous mutineers of the Bounty. They found a tiny but prosperous village consisting of one remaining mutineer, a number of Tahitian women, and dozens of children. Life was well ordered; homes were clean and well built, the sabbath was observed, the log was meticulously maintained, and the calendar was wrong. By one day.  En resumen, en 1808 llegó a la isla el barco mercante Topaz, siendo el primer contacto de la isla con el exterior desde que la colonia fue fundada por los amotinados del HMS Bounty. El último amotinado aún vivo en la isla era muy riguroso y ordenado en sus costumbres y horarios salvo por un pequeño detalle... arrastraba un desfase de un día. Parece ser que durante su huida los amotinados cruzaron la línea internacional de cambio de fecha sin darse cuenta. Durante casi 25 años vivieron con un desfase de un día (incluyendo por ejemplo el día semanal de oración).\nComo consecuencia divertida de este error, según se menciona en los comentarios de Skepticblog, Fletcher Christian (el líder de los amotinados) puso Thursday October (Jueves Octubre) a su primogénito por el día en que nació, aunque posteriormente se supo que realmente nació un Viernes. Durante un tiempo Jueves se hizo llamar Viernes y de hecho los sellos de Pitcairn dedicados a él le nombran como Friday October Christian, aunque luego retornase al nombre original.\nEn este mismo blog:\n Isla Pitcairn Más sobre la Isla Pitcairn  ",

El motivo es que vamos a formar parte de un proyecto europeo de divulgación científica llamado ComScience en el que por parte española participa el Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC). Este proyecto persigue la divulgación científica de ciertos temas a nivel local, orientada especialmente a público no habitual en ambientes académicos. La coincidencia de buena parte de esos objetivos con nuestro formato propició que hace unos meses se pusieran en contacto con nosotros y nos ofrecieran participar en este interesante proyecto.\nLogo del CSIC  Al estar englobado en un proyecto de investigación habrá ciertas diferencias con otras ediciones, esencialmente una parte del público será encuestada antes y después del evento para estudiar las diferencias. En cuanto al formato, será básicamente lo mismo, una charla de unos 30 minutos seguido en este caso por la proyección de un vídeo corto sobre el tema en cuestión. Otra diferencia importante llegará en el debate, ya que una primera parte del mismo se organizará en unos pocos grupos de 10 personas que deberán tratar internamente ciertos asuntos del tema a tratar antes de participar en el debate general.\nLos temas a tratar en las charlas de ComScience son cinco: investigación con células madre, uso de organismos modificados genéticamente, obesidad y diabetes de tipo 2, alergias y asma, y contaminantes en nuestra comida. En este pasado mes de octubre han tratado dos de estos temas con un público juvenil y para noviembre han quedado dos temas destinados a un público adulto, que son los que realizaremos en colaboración con ellos.\nEl sábado 12 de Noviembre tendremos una prometedora charla sobre transgénicos a cargo de Miguel Vicente, Profesor de Investigación y Jefe del Laboratorio de Control Genético del Ciclo Celular en el Centro Nacional de Biotecnología del CSIC.\nEl 26 de Noviembre la charla será sobre asma y alergias a cargo de Victoria del Pozo, Doctora en Biología especializada en Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, y Directora del Laboratorio de Inmunoalergia del Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de la Fundación Jiménez Díaz\nComo es habitual, las charlas tendrá lugar en el Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria, 6) a las 19:30.

Además en este caso será un honor por haber sido invitado a asistir gracias a mi pertenencia a ARP Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico.

Ha recibido por ello varios premios. Cree, y no le falta razón, que el decrecimiento no es una opción, sino que vendrá impuesto por los propios límites del crecimiento.   Shirin Ebadi   Abogada iraní, activista por los Derechos Humanos y ganadora del Premio Nobel de la Paz en 2003. Fue la primera persona iraní y la primera mujer musulmana en obtener un Nobel. Inició su activismo cuando tuvo que dejar de ser Juez en su país porque desde la Revolución Iraní dejó de ser legal que una mujer ejerciera dicha profesión.   Wang Xiaoping   Pensadora, escritora e ideóloga del Partido Comunista Chino. En sus ideas y obra se refleja la China actual, los últimos avances en genética, tecnología, astronáutica, etc. combinados con Taoismo y tradición. Según parece su debate en este mismo evento el año pasado con Bernard-Henri Lévy y el disidente chino Liu Xiaobo fue tremendamente interesante. Este año han vuelto a juntar a Wang Xiaping con Bernard-Henri Lévy en una mesa redonda titulada \" El poder de la Libertad\". La cosa promete.   Además, gracias al acuerdo publicitario entre el evento y el canal de televisión TNT se emitirán durante el congreso varios spots de la serie The Big Bang Theory y se dice que tendrán bastante presencia en varias actividades. Como posible sorpresa, no me extrañaría que apareciera en algún momento Jim Parsons como ejemplo popular actual de mente brillante en su papel como Sheldon Cooper.\nPara finalizar les dejo uno de los vídeos promocionales. Son bastante divertidos:\n   ",

    "body": " Como nota final del congreso Escépticos 2011 Antes del fin del mundo celebrado el pasado fin de semana en l'Alfàs del Pi (Alicante), se ha hecho pública una declaración en la web de ARP Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico a la que me sumo y doy difusión:\n Escépticos 2011 Antes del fin del mundo  A lo largo de la historia ha habido multitud de agoreros que han preconizado el fin del mundo de forma inminente. Unos fueron tachados de bobos, otros quemados por herejes y unos pocos tratados como reyes. Todos fallaron, por fortuna, en sus predicciones. Muchas de estas cábalas acabaron con sus creadores, pero también con personas inocentes que los creyeron a pies juntillas y llegaron incluso a la inmolación por esta causa. No hay que mirar muy lejos para poner ejemplos de ello, y basta como ejemplo los suicidios colectivos de la secta de las Puertas del Cielo en San Diego, la Restauración de los Diez mandamientos de Dios en Uganda, o el frustrado intento que acabó en matanza en la localidad de Waco (Texas). En el momento de escribir estas palabras se acerca el apocalipsis predicho por los mayas y una serie de desastres naturales acabarán con nuestro planeta. O, más bien, un fin del mundo anunciado por un guionista de películas taquilleras de Hollywood. Estamos cansados de los profetas, de los adivinos, de los agoreros. Estamos hartos de que nos quieran tomar el pelo con sus estúpidas cábalas sin fundamento; de sus ínfulas de sabelotodo para sacarnos los cuartos. Hastiados de que usen las noticias de los descubrimientos científicos para engañar a la población, o de que inventen falsas historias sobre civilizaciones desaparecidas. También denunciamos a los que tienen por oficio la alarma al precio que sea, a los que creen que todo es una conspiración contra la humanidad. Señalamos a los que se creen más sabios que la ciencia, y ponen en peligro la salud de los demás, aplicando técnicas de agricultura obsoletas, eludiendo los avances científicos y sometiéndose a inútiles sesiones de curandería, o impidiendo la protección que ofrecen las vacunas a quienes deberían ser sus bienes más preciados: sus hijos. Defendemos el uso del pensamiento crítico y la razón. Por suerte, somos conocedores de la fragilidad de la vida en este pequeño punto azul pálido que, como dijo Carl Sagan, es nuestro planeta. Tenemos a nuestra disposición una inmensa colección de conocimientos que nos explican cómo nacemos, cómo vivimos y cómo morimos; cómo ha ido cambiando nuestro planeta de forma, e incluso tenemos modelos muy complejos de cómo puede transformarse hasta el colapso de la civilización humana. Reivindicamos, pues, nuestro derecho a vivir en paz sin agoreros. El conocimiento nos hace cada vez más libres, pero nos preocupa aquellas personas que son vulnerables a estos mensajes, a vivir con la angustia de este final o, en el peor de los casos, a morir con ella. Probablemente mañana no será el fin del mundo. Deja de preocuparte y disfruta de la vida. l’Alfàs del Pi, 8 de octubre de 2011  ",

    "body": " Dentro de algo más de una semana vuelve Escépticos en el Pub a Madrid, en su tercera temporada en la capital. La pausa veraniega ha durado más de lo que nos habría gustado a algunos, entre otras cosas porque esta edición se traslada del primer sábado de mes al día 22 de Octubre para facilitar la presencia del ponente.\nLos productos naturales, ¡vaya timo!  En esta ocasión el ponente es José Miguel Mulet, licenciado en Química por la Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (UPV), doctor en la especialidad de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular y desde 2008 profesor de Biotecnología en el Instituto de Biología Molecular y Celular de Plantas un centro perteneciente a la UPV y al Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC).\nSu charla se titula \"¿Es ecológica la agricultura ecológica?\". El propio ponente nos ha facilitado un resumen:\n Cada vez parece que el consumidor medio está más interesado no solo en la calidad y seguridad de la cesta de la compra, sino en que la producción sea respetuosa con el medio ambiente. El sello de producción ecológica parece que garantiza este requisito. El consumidor que quiera, o pueda permitirse pagar un poco más no solo obtiene una alimentación de mayor calidad sino que además protege al medio ambiente… o no. En la charla analizaremos cual es el significado de los diversos sellos de producción ecológica, que es lo que engloban y si realmente garantizan una mayor calidad, seguridad o una producción respetuosa con el medio ambiente.  El gran Mulet acaba de participar como ponente tanto en el congreso Amazings Bilbao como en Escépticos 2011, donde pude coincidir con él. En ambos casos ha sido para hablar principalmente de transgénicos, una de sus especialidades. No en vano es autor, y sigue de gira haciendo presentaciones, del libro Los productos naturales, ¡vaya timo!\nComo ya era habitual, la charla tendrá lugar en The Irish Corner (C/ Arturo Soria nº 6, Madrid) el próximo sábado 22 de Octubre a las 19:30. Recuerden que la entrada es gratis y libre, aunque pueden facilitar bastante las tareas de organización si tienen la gentileza de rellenar este formulario.\n",

    "body": " En unas horas partiré hacia Alicante para uno de los eventos del año en España en cuanto a divulgación y escepticismo. El I Congreso Escéptico 2011 \"Antes del fin del mundo\" organizado por ARP Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico. Aparte del consabido networking (los corrillos de toda la vida), las principales charlas y actividades son las siguientes:\nI Congreso Escéptico 2011    Magia, mentalismo y paranormales   Por Andrés Carmona Campo. Dentro del mundo de lo paranormal abundan el uso fraudulento del mentalismo, ilusionismo etc. En esta amena charla se demostrará como los efectos de telepatía, precognición etc. se pueden conseguir sin poderes a la vez que se denuncia el uso fraudulento de un arte destinado a entretener y fascinar al público no a infundirle creencias erróneas.   Política Basada en Pruebas   Por Félix Áres de Blas. Muchas veces las decisiones políticas tienen que ver con la ideología de cada uno; pero hay otras para las cuales hay una respuesta científica conocida o que se puede investigar fácilmente. Pedimos a los políticos que en esos dos últimos casos tengan en cuenta las pruebas.   Aditivos, transgénicos y amenazas alimentarias   Por JM Mulet. En occidente tenemos el privilegio de poder comer todos los días. A veces no somos conscientes de toda la ciencia y todo el esfuerzo que supone ir a un supermercado y poder encontrar una gran variedad de comida que puede solventar todas las necesidades nutricionales a un precio asequible y segura para nuestra salud. A pesar de eso abundan los mitos y las leyendas urbanas relacionadas con ciertos alimentos a los que se atribuyen propiedades nocivas o perjudiciales. ¿Qué hay de cierto en eso? ¿nos estamos envenenado con los aditivos alimentarios? ¿es mejor la comida natural? ¿decir que un alimento tiene química implica que es malo? ¿Qué son los transgénicos? ¿son tan malos como los pintan? En la ponencia tratare de arrojar un poco de luz sobre estas cuestiones que nos afectan a todos, todos los días, puesto que, por suerte, comemos todos los días.   Serán tonterías, pero son peligrosas   Por Ismael Pérez Fernández. Las pseudociencias pueden parecer inocuas incluso puede parecer que no son más que tonterías, pero son muchos los peligros que encierran, algunos incluso pueden amenazar a la sociedad democrática en sí.   Mesa redonda: Pensamiento Crítico en la red   Intervienen: Borja Robert, Adela Torres Calatayud y Manuel Hermán. Internet, la red de redes, lugar de paraíso y de pesadilla, en ella podemos encontrar desde lo más irracional hasta información muy valiosa que nos puede ser útil a la hora de tener que ejercer nuestro pensamiento crítico. De todo ello será de lo que hablaremos.   No te creas todo lo que te dicen   Por Javier Armentia Fructuoso. Televisión, radio, prensa e internet, la información nos llega por todos lados ¿pero es todo realmente información valiosa? ¿Podemos confiar en los medios? Veremos como un sano escepticismo es más que necesario, no podemos creernos todo lo que leemos o vemos en los medios.   Mesa redonda: La persistencia de las pseudociencias   Intervienen: Félix Ares de Blas, Ismael Pérez Fernández y Andrés Carmona Campo. El pensamiento pseudocientífico y mágico está extendido en nuestra sociedad ¿ha sido esto siempre así? ¿Es algo ligado a nuestros cerebros?¿Depende de la sociedad? Estás y otras cuestiones eran sobre las que hablemos y debatamos.   10 Formas de acabar con el mundo   Por Eugenio Manuel Fernández Aguilar. La creencia en el fin del mundo vuelve a estar de moda, en esta ocasión viene ligada a una supuesta profecía de los Mayas. Veremos que no es la única y que por supuesto todas esas profecías han sido y son erróneas.   ",

El acceso estará limitado por el aforo del lugar (bastante amplio) y aunque es recomendable no es necesaria inscripción salvo para las comidas y cenas organizadas.\nSe podrá asistir a diversas actividades, charlas y mesas redondas con destacados divulgadores y escépticos, todos ellos miembros de la asociación. Les dejo la nota publicada por la organización:\n ARP - Sociedad para el Avance del Pensamiento Crítico anuncia la celebración del I Congreso ARP-SAPC los días 8 y 9 de octubre de 2011 en el Centro Social «Platja Albir» de L’Alfàs del Pi (Alicante), y que llevará por título «Escépticos 2011. Antes del fin del mundo». El congreso se enmarca dentro de las actividades de impulso del pensamiento crítico, la educación científica y el uso de la razón propias de la asociación. De forma completamente abierta al público, se realizarán una serie de charlas con ponentes de reconocido prestigio en las que se tratarán diversas creencias irracionales. Desde el inminente, según algunos, advenimiento del “fin del mundo” en 2012 que da titulo al congreso, hasta el análisis racional de aditivos, transgénicos y amenazas alimentarias, pasando por la defensa de una política basada en pruebas o la llamada de atención sobre “el lado oscuro de la era de la información” (no te creas todo lo que te cuentan), entre otros temas de indudable interés. Sumado a estas charlas, se celebrarán varias mesas redondas: «Pensamiento crítico en la red» y «Persistencia de las pseudociencias». Todo ello amenizado con interludios de humor y música escépticos llevados a cabo por socios de ARP-SAPC. La asistencia a este congreso es gratuita tanto para socios como para no socios. Además, Andrés Carmona se encargará de impartir un taller formativo sobre magia, exclusivo para socios de ARP-SAPC, en el que se expondrán algunas de las técnicas procedentes del ilusionismo y el mentalismo que son empleadas por videntes, adivinos y psíquicos para aparentar tener poderes mentales como la telepatía, telequinesia o precognición, denunciando este mal uso del noble arte del ilusionismo. La información completa sobre inscripción, programa de actividades y todo lo relativo a este evento puede encontrarse en la web principal de ARP-SAPC, http://www.escepticos.es, o en la diseñada específicamente para albergar este congreso: http://congreso2011.escepticos.es/  Ya está abierto el periodo de inscripción.

    "body": " Un interesante vídeo acerca del flujo laminar (laminar flow) que muestra a fluidos funcionando en capas. Lo explican perfectamente en la web de este experimento:\n This apparatus is an effective and safe educational tool or conceptual aide that displays the properties of laminar flow. The apparatus is designed to for easy operations and cleaning and provides great visual, real-time display of laminar flow. Students and educators will enjoy using the apparatus while gaining valuable knowledge of fluid dynamics. When a fluid (gas or liquid) flows in a defined manner with distinct paths it is said to be in laminar flow. Laminar flow is a fundamental physical phenomenon that occurs frequently in everyday life. However, the concept of laminar flow can sometimes be difficult to put into context when discussing fluid dynamics. Turbulent flow on the other hand may be a little easier to explain as the only requirement is that there is no order to the fluids fluctuations. When attempting to illustrate the properties associated with laminar flow this apparatus is most effective. This apparatus allows for the visual examination of a fluid undergoing laminar flow. Initially, within the apparatus, various colored droplets are suspended in a fluid and all are in a state of equilibrium where the different fluids are distinctly separated. When the apparatus is rotated the fluids revolve in a controlled manner and the droplets seem to become completely intermixed yet still divided from the outer fluid. After several rotations the apparatus is then operated in the reverse direction. Since the Reynolds number within this apparatus is less then one, an almost complete reversal of the previous laminar flow is undertaken. The result is that after the same amount of rotations in the opposite direction, the droplets return to their initial, distinctly separated, forms.     Este aparato ha sido desarrollado por John DeMoss y Kevin Cahill del Departamento de Física y Astronomía de la Universidad de Nuevo México. Si alguien cree que puede darle el uso divulgativo que merece, en su web podemos comprar el aparato por unos módicos 450 dólares.\n(vía SkeptTV)\n",

A estos 50 se van uniendo más candidatos, y la intención del SETI es explorar los mil más probables en un plazo de un par de años. El coste estimado para cumplir con este objetivo son cinco millones de dólares.\nAhora que la financiación existente (pública y privada) no es suficiente, es nuestro momento como ciudadanos de ayudar. Yo ya he donado, y seguramente volveré a hacerlo, y tú puedes hacer lo mismo en este enlace:\n Unlike SETI experiments of the past, which examined star systems that might have orbiting worlds, Kepler is specifying with unprecedented precision where we should hunt for signals. Consequently, the SETI Institute is embarking on a two-year campaign to check out the thousand plus best of the Kepler candidates. You can make this search possible. The search for life on Kepler worlds will swing the antennas of the Allen Telescope Array in the directions of these top priority targets, and hunt for signals on an incredible 10 billion channels for each. The search will cost $5 million. That’s why we’re appealing to you – someone who recognizes that the evolutionary drama that has taken place on our planet may have happened on other worlds. You can donate any amount, simply by hitting the button below. Each dollar you contribute buys 4 million channels scrutiny of a single world. Let’s find some cosmic company together!

Si falta alguno ya estáis tardando en comentarlo)\n(18-06-2011: Two podcasts added to the list)\nFor those who didn't know Tim Farley, he is the creator and promoter of the splendid site What's the Harm and his very useful blog Skeptical Software Tools. Part of this huge activism was a recent initiative to measure the skeptical podcasting, so I've been requested to make a list of the known skeptical podcasts in Spanish. It'll be easy for me as I am a frequent listener (and often friend) of them. To help him, with each program I'll add a brief description, extracted if possible from the source.\n Pensando Críticamente (Critically Thinking) by Ismael Pérez and Borja Robert. Ismael and Borja are staff members of Escépticos en el Pub Madrid. Each month they interview the speaker of our main Skeptics in the Pub event, to promote and share this kind of skeptical activism with huge success in Madrid. El Rincón Prohibido (The Forbidden Corner) by Mauricio-José Schwarz. It's a space for information, unorthodox views and artistic expressions that can not find space in traditional media, which tend to be very busy promoting pseudoscience, mysteries of paper-mache, junk music and literature consumption. The main subjects are Science and pseudosciences, music, poetry and social issues. Escépticos and Magonia by Luis Alfonso Gámez. Mainly about appearances of skeptic personalities and comments in national radio broadcast. Luis A. Gámez is also the host of the TV program Escépticos. Podcast Irreductible (The Irreducible Podcast) by Javier Peláez. This is about Science and History, often mixed up. There are almost 40 episodes with several biographies, historical and scientific facts. El Esceptiradar (The Skeptic Radar) by Borja Robert. This is the most recent addition and Borja's last adventure (beside helping with Skepticamp Madrid). El EsceptiRadar tries to analyze frauds, lies and conspiracies in brief and entertaining episodes of about 10 minutes. Each one of them offers a rational and scientific explanation to the myths and frauds in an specific pseudoscience. Episodes should arrive every two weeks aiming to promote critical thinking, fight pseudoscience, teach some cool facts and entertain. La media hostia (The half blow) by Ismael Valladolid. A rational enlightened progressist and atheist podcast. Incrédulos (Unbelievers) by Esteban Umerez. A podcast about skepticism, rationalism, science, and critical thinking.  Curiously, his last entry in the blog is about skeptic activism and the presentation he made some days ago in Skepticamp Atlanta 2011, about how we may (and should!) move our efforts from the traditional blogging (and podcasting) to other activities that are also important, and sure will be essential in our goals, being the Skepticamp format the main key.\nConcerning the open events format, and the Skepticamp Madrid itself, I'm eager to start talking about it in the next days. Stay tuned!\n",

    "body": " (Entrada publicada originalmente en Enchufa2, que difundo por solidaridad tras saber que han sido amenazados con ser denunciados)\nEsta es la transcripción de un fragmento de vídeo visto este miércoles en el Intermedio (vídeo 2, minuto 20’30”). En ella, una mujer (presumiblemente anciana) llama al programa nocturno del vidente Sandro Rey de La Sexta, para preguntar por la salud de su nieta. Se produce entonces la siguiente conversación:\n —Hola, buenas noches. —Hola buenas noches. —¿En qué le puedo ayudar señora? —Pues quería saber por la salud de una nieta. —La salud de su nieta… hombre, aquí lo que más salen son alergias e insuficiencias respiratorias. ¿Cómo se llama usted? —Yo soy Leo. —Pues lo que veo más es cansancio físico o psíquico, o sea, “farta” de oxígeno, alguna alergia, algún problema en las vías respiratorias, las fosas nasales, faringe, bronquitis… eso es lo que yo le veo a esta nena. Pero no le veo nada malo, es pasajero, o sea… —No, no, no… la niña no tiene eso eh, nada de eso. —Bueno, eso es lo que yo estoy viendo. —No, no, no, no. —¿Qué tiene la niña? —La niña tiene una enfermedad que le llaman Crohn, el Crohn. Y alergia no tiene ninguna. —Sí… bueno, piense que… pero piense que esa enfermedad le crea una insuficiencia respiratoria. Eso no lo digo yo, lo dicen los doctores de… —De momento no la tiene. —Bueno, esa enfermedad, normalmente, los doctores de este país lo saben, crea a medida que va pasando el tiempo una insuficiencia respiratoria y las defensas al estar muy débiles también crean alergias, alergias internas-externas, o sea… Esa es la enfermedad que usted dice que tiene esa nena. Pues muy bien, pero deriva, deriva… o sea, lo que yo digo estoy diciendo es deriva. Y ella, aunque ahora no lo tenga no quiere decir que no lo vaya a tener pero yo, a la nena, lo que sí le recomiendo es que la pongáis en manos de un buen homeópata.  Es decir, que el tipo le diagnostica a la nena alergia, insuficiencias respiratorias, cansancio físico, cansancio psíquico, falta de oxígeno, problemas en las fosas nasales, la faringe, bronquitis… todo ello pasajero. Y cuando la nena resulta tener una enfermedad crónica intestinal este señor insiste en que ha acertado ¡y le recomienda acudir al homeópata! Desde luego, el que no se consuela es porque no quiere. Por no hablar de su total desconocimiento de la enfermedad de Crohn o las alergias (más le vadría tener un buen acceso a Google y dejar de darle vueltas a la dichosa bolita). Quizás su único acierto (pura poesía) haya sido afiliarse tan oportunamente con esos timadores reconocidos. Habría que incluir una advertencia de este tipo en los medicamentos homeopáticos:\n  Es de chiste y tendría muchísima gracia si no fuese tan real. Hay gente, especialmente la más vulnerable, que confía verdaderamente en estos estafadores. Y lo malo no es que necesiten una palabra de consuelo y alguien se la proporcione. Supongo que alguien que llama a un programa así tiene una pregunta que no sale de su cabeza y sólo desea darle solución de forma positiva (si recibiese una mala noticia, la preocupación no se disiparía y eso lo saben bien los videntes timadores). Lo malo es cuando este consuelo pretende sustituir al consejo oportuno de un experto, suplantar al médico, cuando se atreve a dar diagnósticos y a sugerir tratamientos. Entonces pone en verdadero riesgo la salud de quien confía en él, a veces más que en su propio médico.\n¿No se podrían prohibir este tipo de conductas? ¿denunciar al estafador por negligente en casos parecidos? Sería tan sencillo como obligarles a dar una respuesta estándar cuando se trate de temas médicos. Podría incluso estar grabada, una voz en off que resonaría en el plató automáticamente ante la llamada oportuna: “Las autoridades sanitarias advierten que este intrigante no está autorizado a estafarle en temas relacionados con su salud. Si busca consejo, hable con su médico”. A fin de cuentas, no creo que las cajetillas de tabaco sean mucho más perjudiciales que estos señores.\n",

Uno de mis géneros favoritos, dicho sea de paso.\nDicho esto, acabo de ver que Technology Review —publicación del M.I.T.— tiene previsto publicar a lo largo del año la colección TR:SF con relatos de ciencia ficción dura. Se justifica, en palabras de la publicación, porque son este tipo de historias, inspiradas en la ciencia y tecnología más vanguardista, las más citadas por científicos e ingenieros como inspiración para sus proyectos.\nA raíz de esto acaban de publicar una lista con las 10 mejores obras de este género, que en gran medida han inspirado la colección. Me permitirán que mantenga el idioma original.\n  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea (Jules Verne, 1870) Verne wrote some of the earliest works recognizable as science fiction (even though the term \"science fiction\" wouldn't enter popular culture for another 60 years.) Twenty Thousand Leagues is probably his most prescient work, anticipating submarine warfare (not for nothing was the first nuclear submarine called Nautilus) , scuba diving, and even the taser. The Time Machine (H.G. Wells, 1895) There's a little bit of self-plagarism in this book, as the operating principles of the eponymous machine are pretty much directly lifted from an earlier short story written by Wells, called The Chronic Argonauts, published in 1888, seven years before The Time Machine. Still, the 1895 book deserves credit for popularizing the idea that time travel might be done using scientific and technological methods, rather than the magical means used in earlier time travel stories. Its description of time travel in a four-dimensional universe presaged the cottage industry in theoretical space-time machines that has sprung up among physicists in recent decades. I, Robot (Isaac Asimov, 1950) Asimov actually invented the word \"robotics,\" in 1941, and this collection of short stories canonized his most famous literary creation, the Three Laws of Robotics (\"A robot may not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws.\") Although Asimov was very hazy on how the \"positronic brains\" of his robots actually worked, the idea of a machine operating perfectly, but behaving strangely because of unexpected interactions between its instructions, would become all too familiar to later generations of computer programmers battling subtle software bugs. The Shockwave Rider (John Brunner, 1975) The original cyberpunk novel, predating Gibson' Neuromancer by nine years (and even the word \"cyberpunk\" by five.) Admittedly, it doesn't feature a neon-lit virtual reality cyberspace, but it does have a hacker who unleashes a little doozey on the global computer network—a self replicating program that Brunner dubbed a \"worm.\" In 1982 researchers at Xerox PARC noticed the real work they were on distributed computation doing bore a striking resemblance to Brunner's fictional creation, and by 1988 the first worm to be released into the wild was happily munching through thousands of computers on the early Internet. The Fountains of Paradise (Arthur C. Clark, 1979) If we ever actually build a space elevator—a high tension cable 100,000 km long suspended from a counterweight in high Earth orbit all the way down to the surface of the Earth, which would let people ride elevator cars into orbit—people will look back on this book the way nuclear submarine designers look back at 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Although Clark didn't invent the concept of the space elevator, he did do some of the real-world calculations showing how such a structure might work, and even speculated that a carbon-based filament would make the ideal material for the elevator cable. Twenty years later, carbon nanotubes were at the heart of NASA first serious study on space elevators. Cyteen (C.J. Cherryh, 1988) Set on a harsh world whose settlers have a fractious relationship with Earth, this book looks at an attempt to push human cloning beyond the creation of a genetic duplicate. Scientists try to recreate the personality of one of their society's most valuable citizens by creating similar childhood experiences, as Cherryh deftly explores the nature vs. nurture debate. The Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson, 1992-1996) This tale of the colonization of Mars begins in 2026 and ends two hundred years later, with the terraforming of Mars largely completed and humanity making its first steps into interstellar space. Packed with detailed descriptions of the colonist's everyday lives, and a close attention to the geography of Mars, it's as close as any of us will get to walking on the red planet. (If, sometime after reading this, you become an actual explorer of Mars, feel free to look me up and berate me for my lack of faith in you. It'll be something to tell the other people at the old folks home.) The Diamond Age (Neal Stephenson, 1995) This is the tale of an impoverished young girl who accidentally comes into the possession of one of the most sophisticated devices ever created—an educational primer that can adapt itself to almost any situation that its reader finds herself in. In creating the primer, and the entire world the child lives in, Stephenson has perfectly channeled Eric Drexler's vision of molecular nanotechnology, where microscopic machines perform near-miracles on a regular basis. Rainbows End (Vernor Vinge, 2006) When I first read this book, I thought the setting of 2025 was unrealistically optimistic for the kind of augmented reality technology that is at the heart of the book. Using goggles, digital information from the Internet is overlaid on the world around the wearer. A person's social networking profile might appear beside their head, or an entire landscape can be mapped to some fantasy world, where a monsters and dragons are painted over cars and airplanes. But real world technology is catching up much more rapidly than I ever expected. Incandescence (Greg Egan, 2008) Its far-future setting, and backdrop of a galaxy-spanning civilization, would normally put this book firmly into the category of space opera, but Egan—who has contributed a science fiction story to Technology Review previously—has written a book that could double as a primer on General Relativity and astrophysics. Much of the action takes place on a bizarre pre-industrial world, where the characters need to come up with some advanced physics—fast—if they are to avoid disaster.   (Visto en Reddit)\n",

Por ahora os dejo con la convocatoria, y os ruego que le deis la máxima difusión.\n Estimados: El escepticismo y la defensa del pensamiento crítico están creciendo con paso firme por estas tierras. Cada vez tenemos más eventos, más blogs y más gente interesada en denunciar fraudes pseudocientíficos y compartir su amor por el conocimiento. También tenemos cada vez más voz. Creemos que es un buen momento para dar un pasito más. Os convocamos a todos a la fiesta preorganizativa del primer Skepticamp en español de la historia. La celebraremos después de la cena -de rigor- del Escépticos en el Pub Madrid de junio. Será por tanto el Sábado 4 de junio a eso de las 22:30 en el Irish Corner (C/Arturo Soria 6). Skepticamp logo  Un Skepticamp es una jornada abierta de escepticismo y ciencia. Los eventos abiertos se caracterizan por su modo de organización y por la facilidad para participar en ellos. Se trata de un evento informal en el que el novatos y expertos, jóvenes y adultos trabajan de la mano para aprender, enseñar y pasárselo bien. Un día en el que todo el que quiera puede dar una charla breve sobre ese tema que le inspira. Una buena oportunidad para organizar una actividad interesante y divertida. Una fiesta en la que participar, hacer amigos y colaborar en la defensa de la ciencia y el pensamiento crítico. Siendo un evento abierto aún no hay nada decidido, sólo que queremos hacerlo y vamos a hacerlo. En la fiesta preorganizativa intentaremos sentar unas bases mínimas: los canales de comunicación para la organización, definir algunas tareas imprescindibles, sus responsables y, de manera general, cómo nos gustaría que fuese este primer Skepticamp. Ya vendrán la elección de fecha, duración, lugar y todas las pequeñas cosas importantes cuando sepamos quienes somos -o estamos-. No hace falta que tengas mucho tiempo libre para ser parte de la organización. Con tener un poquito, y ganas de formar parte del primer evento escéptico abierto en español, es más que suficiente para que te animes a venir.

    "body": " The Ice Book es una maravillosa obra de arte creada por Davy McGuire y Kristin McGuire. Como resumen rápido se trata de unas pequeñas obras de teatro proyectadas sobre un libro popup para conseguir fantásticos efectos de perspectiva, ilusiones ópticas y magia. Mejor les dejo con este vídeo:\n   En palabras de los autores:\n I always had the dream of creating a theatre performance that opened up like a pop-up book. A show that would mix video projections with live actors to create a totally immersive experience. We wanted to create a full scale, life-size theatre production. The idea for the Icebook was to create a miniature maquette for this dream – a demonstration model to show to producers and other funders in the hope that they would give us some money to make the full scale show. (And we still hope that this will come true one day!) The Icebook has since however, grown its own legs and turned into a miniature show all by itself. An intimate performance for small audiences. We love the old pre-cinematic optical illusions, such as zeotropes and magic lanterns, and the magical way in which they can mesmerise audiences through basic mechanics. Rather than simply projecting images onto a screen, we wanted to create an object with a life of its own – a tangible and magical “thing” for an audience to experience. When Kristin first held a pop-up in front of a lamp we were fascinated by the utterly beautiful effect of the light coming through the paper, creating shadows and silhouettes which we could then enhance and complement with back projected film-footage. In the Icebook, the 3D effect is achieved by back projecting onto the pop ups. Using this technique the projected characters appear as if they are moving behind the cut-outs and thus the illusion of perspective is created  (Visto en Mira y Calla)\n",

El tema a tratar será la radiación, siendo el ponente Fernando Arqueros, Catedrático de Física Atómica, Molecular y Nuclear de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Su charla presenta un título magnífico y prometedor: Radiaciones ionizantes: tan naturales como el viento, tan peligrosas como el huracán. El propio Fernando Arqueros ha dejado un resumen:\n La Tierra y nosotros en ella estamos sometidos a la radiación cósmica y a la emitida por fuentes radiactivas naturales. Nosotros mismos somos radiactivos. Es tan natural como el viento. Durante el siglo pasado el Hombre ha conseguido producir de manera artificial sustancias radiactivas que en cantidades masivas pueden llegar a ser peligrosas. Sin embargo, el mayor peligro de la radiación es su \"invisibilidad\". Lo mismo sentimos cuando estamos siendo sometidos a una dosis mortal que cuando no hay ningún peligro. Pero basta que digas a alguien que hay radiación en el ambiente para que le empiece a \"picar\" todo el cuerpo. Para evitar miedos absurdos basta seguir algunas reglas racionales. La misma receta se aplica para evitar riesgos innecesarios.

    "title": "Fermat's Last Theorem de Simon L. Singh",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Acabo de terminar la lectura de Fermat's Last Theorem (El último teorema de Fermat en su edición española) del autor británico Simon L. Singh. A pesar de haber tardado bastante en acabarlo (diversos líos me han tenido alejado de cualquier libro) me ha parecido una lectura muy amena y totalmente recomendable. Antes de seguir, debo indicar que este libro lo conseguí en la pasada TAM London 2010 firmado por el propio autor.\nSimon Lehna Singh, galardonado con la Orden del Imperio Británico, es conocido principalmente por sus trabajos acerca de ciencia y matemáticas. Sus obras más importantes son ésta sobre el último teorema de Fermat, The Code Book (sobre criptografía), Big Bang (sobre el origen del universo, que regalé también firmado a un buen amigo) y su última publicación Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial (sobre los peligros de la medicina alternativa).\nFue además conocido por la ciudadanía británica y por los escépticos de todo el mundo tras ganar su juicio contra la British Chiropractic Association (Asociación Quiropráctica Británica), que le demandó por difamación por una columna de Singh en The Guardian en la que éste indicaba que dicha asociación \"promovía alegremente tratamientos falsos\" (\"happily promote bogus treatments\", me encanta la frase original). La sentencia absolvió a Singh y además desembocó en una oleada de demandas ciudadanas por publicidad engañosa contra más de 500 quiroprácticos, y en la obligatoriedad a la asociación de retirar de todas las webs y clínicas de sus asociados cualquier referencia a tratamientos curativos que no tuvieran eficacia demostrada. Es decir, todos ellos.\n Andrew Wiles\nSource: Klaus Barner @ Wikimedia Commons - CC BY-SA  Volviendo a la obra, en este caso Singh narra la búsqueda por parte de la comunidad matemática mundial durante más de 350 años de una prueba para el último Teorema de Pierre de Fermat, abogado francés del siglo XVII que como matemático amateur consiguió ser (y sigue siendo aún ahora) toda una referencia. Además de su extensa producción, ha pasado a la historia por este último teorema y su leyenda, siendo considerado como el problema matemático más difícil hasta que Andrew Wiles lo consiguió probar en 1995.\nEl último teorema de Fermat, brevemente, se puede enunciar diciendo que siendo n un número entero mayor que 2, entonces no existen números naturales a, b y c, tales que se cumpla an + bn = cn. Este enunciado aparentemente simple se resistió durante siglos a varias generaciones.\nAdemás de su dificultad, se hizo más grande y desafiante aún dado que el propio Fermat, poco amigo de compartir sus investigaciones, lo conjeturó en el margen de un ejemplar de Arithmética (de Diofanto de Alejandría) afirmando de su puño y letra que tenía la prueba para el teorema pero era demasiado grande para incluirla en dicho margen. Tremendo humor, y tremenda ira para aquellos que no eran muy aficionados a Fermat.\nEl libro va narrando capítulo a capítulo toda esta mítica historia, desde el propio Fermat y su compleja relación con sus contemporáneos, pasando por los principales intentos posteriores de probar dicho teorema hasta llegar al intento definitivo por parte de Andrew Wiles tras más de 6 años de dedicación exclusiva en secreto.\nComo introducción, antes de entrar en la propia historia, el autor explica de forma tremendamente clara, didáctica y (milagrosamente) amena ciertos conceptos básicos de matemática teórica. De estas primeras páginas he extraído un fragmento que os resultará interesante, más allá de la propia historia del Teorema.\nAbsolute Proof The story of Fermat's Last Theorem revolves around the search for a missing proof. Mathematical proof is far more powerful and rigorous than the concept of proof we casually use in our everyday language, or even the concept of proof as understood by physicists or chemists. The difference between scientific and mathematical proof is both subtle and profound, and is crucial to understanding the work of every mathematician since Pythagoras. The idea of a classic mathematical proof is to begin with a series of axioms, statements that can be assumed to be true or that are self-evidently true. Then by arguing logically, step by step, it is possible to arrive at a conclusion. If the axioms are correct and the logic is flawless, then the conclusion will be undeniable. This conclusion is the theorem. Mathematical theorems rely on this logical process and once proven are true until the end of time. Mathematical proofs are absolute. To appreciate the value of such proofs they should be compared with their poor relation, the scientific proof. In science a hypothesis is put forward to explain a physical phenomenon. If observations of the phenomenon compare well with the hypothesis, this becomes evidence in favor of it. Furthermore, the hypothesis should not merely describe a known phenomenon, but predict the results of other phenomena. Experiments may be performed to test the predictive power of the hypothesis, and if it continues to be successful then this is even more evidence to back the hypothesis. Eventually the amount of evidence may be overwhelming and the hypothesis becomes accepted as a scientific theory. However, the scientific theory can never be proved to the same absolute level of a mathematical theorem: It is merely considered highly likely based on the evidence available. So-called scientific proof relies on observation and perception, both of which are fallible and provide only approximations to the truth. As Bertrand Russell pointed out: \"Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation.\" Even the most widely accepted scientific \"proofs\" always have a small element of doubt in them. Sometimes this doubt diminishes, although it never disappears completely, while on other occasions the proof is ultimately shown to be wrong. This weakness in scientific proof leads to scientific revolutions in which one theory that was assumed to be correct is replaced with another theory, which may be merely a refinement of the original theory, or which may be a complete contradiction.

Eustoquio es uno de los  irresponsables  caballeros que se suicidó homeopáticamente conmigo en Zaragoza hace unas semanas. Aquí está el resumen que el autor ha dejado de su charla:\n El negacionismo del cambio climático es una nueva pseudociencia que niega que el calentamiento global esté siendo producido por el hombre, o minimiza su importancia negándose a tomar medidas. Se trata de una pseudociencia porque no cumple con los requisitos básicos del método científico, ignorando el amplio consenso científico puesto de manifiesto por más de 2.000 expertos científicos organizados por la ONU en el Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambio Climático. A pesar de todos los datos científicos acumulados que evidencian el cambio climático de origen antropogénico y los peligros que conlleva, existen bastantes influyentes negacionistas, que son muy combativos en los medios de comunicación más conservadores y algunos tienen mucho poder político. Varios presidentes y ex presidentes de relevantes naciones son negacionistas. En general el negacionismo es fomentado por grandes empresas petroleras y políticos neoliberales partidarios a ultranza del libre mercado, que ven peligrar sus intereses si se toman costosas medidas propugnadas por los ecologistas y científicos. En este sentido, los datos y previsiones científicas están poniendo de manifiesto que los ecologistas no exageraban tanto como se creía.  Ya saben que para asistir no se pide pagar entrada pero sí tomarse algo. Sabemos que no hace falta insistir en este punto. Se ruega confirmar asistencia en este formulario de Google Docs.\nPara rematar el asunto, el Martes 12 de Abril a las 19:30 también en el Irish Corner tendremos el Discurshow de Xurxo Mariño y Vicente de Souza. Este espectáculo de divulgación y entretenimiento, para el que tampoco se cobrará entrada, se resume así por sus autores:\n Un DiscurShow es una charla de divulgación científica aderezada con pinceladas de teatro. Está pensado para ser representado en los amplios escenarios de los teatros pero, ¿y si tratamos de meterlo en un pub? ¡Vamos a intentarlo! Xurxo Mariño es profesor de la Universidade da Coruña, investigador en el campo de la neurofisiología y comunicador científico. Vicente de Souza es actor profesional y director de escena. Matarratas Darwin Todos tenemos alguna idea sobre quién fue Darwin, algunos tienen nociones sobre sus trabajos y teorías –desarrolladas después de viajar por el mundo utilizando para las etapas más largas un barco llamado Beagle–, pero poca gente conoce los motivos reales de ese viaje, las anécdotas que surgieron y las aventuras y desventuras que vivió el joven Darwin entre 1831 y 1836. En su génesis no era un viaje de investigación científica, sino que había un motivo mucho más extraño. ¿Tuvo esto que ver con el suicidio de dos de los capitanes del Beagle? La imagen idílica de un naturalista paseando por la selva y recogiendo plantas y mariposas tiene poco que ver con la realidad a la que se enfrentaba un científico inexperto en medio de la Pampa argentina o entre los habitantes indígenas de Tierra del Fuego. En sus largas rutas –casi siempre a caballo–, Charles Darwin recogió todo tipo de animales: armadillos, guanacos, cóndores, zorros, tortugas, ratas y ratones. Muchos de ellos también los comió. Además, sufrió enfermedades, temporales, terremotos, escaló montañas y pasó frío, miedo y, también, momentos de felicidad extrema al contemplar el planeta Tierra con una mirada abierta, inteligente y llena de curiosidad.

    "body": "  Ya os he hablado de Creative Commons, como si no lo conocierais ya de antes, y puedo ir al grano sin introducciones sobre ello. Ahora que emerge con fuerza el libro electrónico, también lo hacen las tiendas de libros electrónicos. Por ahora la gente sigue siendo algo reacia a pagar, no ayuda nada los desorbitados precios de los eBooks.\nUn gran filón de este tipo de tiendas (y de los usuarios de libro electrónico) son las obras que ya han pasado a dominio público, y las obras que legalmente están disponibles de manera libre (y gratuita) en la red. Hoy voy a hablar de este último caso.\nHay muchos autores, cada vez más, que ponen sus obras a disposición del público con licencias Creative Commons. Yo mismo he reseñado aquí dos de ellas: My own kind of freedom, de Steven Brust y Little Brother de Cory Doctorow.\nSi les interesa como a mi las obras de ciencia ficción y fantasía van a sacarle partido a dos recopilaciones de Feedbooks, un servicio de publicación y distribución de libros.\n 96 obras de ciencia ficción con licencia Creative Commons. 19 obras de fantasía con licencia Creative Commons.  Incluye obras de Cory Doctorow, Benjamin Rosenbaum, Peter Watts o Tom Maddox entre muchos otros.\nNo cometan el error de pensar que estas personas comparten su obra de este modo porque no serían capaces de venderlos de otra manera. He destacado varios autores que de cualquier modo ya venden una gran cantidad de esos libros que también comparten gratuitamente. Puede parecer ilógico o al menos curioso, les resumo los argumentos de Cory Doctorow al respecto (las negritas son mías):\n Giving away ebooks gives me artistic, moral and commercial satisfaction. The commercial question is the one that comes up most often: how can you give away free ebooks and still make money? For me -- for pretty much every writer -- the big problem isn't piracy, it's obscurity (thanks to Tim O'Reilly for this great aphorism). Of all the people who failed to buy this book today, the majority did so because they never heard of it, not because someone gave them a free copy. Mega-hit best-sellers in science fiction sell half a million copies -- in a world where 175,000 attend the San Diego Comic Con alone, you've got to figure that most of the people who \"like science fiction\" (and related geeky stuff like comics, games, Linux, and so on) just don't really buy books. I'm more interested in getting more of that wider audience into the tent than making sure that everyone who's in the tent bought a ticket to be there. [...] The good news (for writers) is that this means that ebooks on computers are more likely to be an enticement to buy the printed book (which is, after all, cheap, easily had, and easy to use) than a substitute for it. You can probably read just enough of the book off the screen to realize you want to be reading it on paper. So ebooks sell print books. Every writer I've heard of who's tried giving away ebooks to promote paper books has come back to do it again. That's the commercial case for doing free ebooks. Now, onto the artistic case. It's the twenty-first century. Copying stuff is never, ever going to get any harder than it is today (or if it does, it'll be because civilization has collapsed, at which point we'll have other problems). Hard drives aren't going to get bulkier, more expensive, or less capacious. Networks won't get slower or harder to access. If you're not making art with the intention of having it copied, you're not really making art for the twenty-first century. [...] Finally, let's look at the moral case. Copying stuff is natural. It's how we learn (copying our parents and the people around us). My first story, written when I was six, was an excited re-telling of Star Wars, which I'd just seen in the theater. Now that the Internet -- the world's most efficient copying machine -- is pretty much everywhere, our copying instinct is just going to play out more and more. There's no way I can stop my readers, and if I tried, I'd be a hypocrite: when I was 17, I was making mix-tapes, photocopying stories, and generally copying in every way I could imagine. If the Internet had been around then, I'd have been using it to copy as much as I possibly could. [...]  Pasen y lean.\n",

    "body": " Visto vía reddit y posteriormente recordado en diversos compartidos y blogs, quiero recomendar desde aquí esta maravilla de vídeos, dados a llamarse The Sagan Series.\nThe Sagan Series es una serie no oficial de vídeos creados por Reid Gower que combinan narraciones de Carl Sagan con espectaculares imágenes y música. Aclaro que no son vídeos oficiales de la NASA, y él mismo ante la confusión y las críticas recibidas tras el primer vídeo incluyó en los siguientes los logotipos de las demás agencias espaciales (con un tamaño proporcional a su presupuesto). En palabras del autor:\n I got frustrated with NASA and made this video. NASA is the most fascinating, adventurous, epic institution ever devised by human beings, and their media sucks. Seriously. None of their brilliant scientists appear to know how to connect with the social media crowd, which is now more important than ever. In fact, NASA is an institution whose funding directly depends on how the public views them. In NASA's defense, they have embraced social media. I guess my point is that they don't fully understand how to best use it. In all of their brilliance, NASA seems to have forgotten to share their hopes and dreams in a way the public can relate to, leaving one of humanity's grandest projects with terrible PR and massive funding cuts.  Es imprescindible que lo vean a pantalla completa y mínimo en 720p, pero de todos modos les dejo aquí los dos primeros capítulos. El primero es The Frontier Is Everywhere (la frontera está en todas partes):\n    El segundo (y último por ahora) es Life Looks for Life (la vida busca vida):\n    Espectacular, tremendamente conmovedor y motivador.

Su presencia y fervor en el vídeo se debe a su pasión por la ciencia y, más concretamente, a su labor como Chancellor (el equivalente a Rector en las universidades españolas) de la Universidad de Huddersfield.\nPero hoy destacaré la otra parte de la historia, la European Spallation Source o Fuente Europea de Neutrones por Espalación. Puedo ahorrarme tanto la explicación acerca de la espalación como sobre la propia ESS, ya que el señor Stewart lo explica perfectamente en el vídeo:\n   Les dejaré unos datos para concluir:\n La ESS es un proyecto europeo, gracias al acuerdo de (actualmente) 16 países, pero no de la propia Unión Europea. El proyecto nació en 1993, y desde 2009 se encuentra en fase de pre-construcción. Esperan poder empezar a construirlo en 2012 para poder abrir en 2019 y que sea totalmente operativo alrededor de 2025. Varias ciudades optaron al centro. Finalmente se decidió entre Debrecen (Hungría), Bilbao y Lund (Suecia), siendo la opción escandinava la que albergará definitivamente el centro. La ESS consta de un acelerador lineal de partículas. La presencia de un acelerador lo asemeja al LHC, pero pueden ver que son proyectos totalmente diferentes. Hay proyectos similares ya construidos en Estados Unidos (el Spallation Neutron Source en el Oak Ridge National Laboratory) y Japón (el J-PARC de la Japan Atomic Energy Agency). Cuando la ESS esté terminada será 10 veces más potente que sus rivales.  ",

    "body": " El próximo día 5 de Febrero manifestantes en varias ciudades del mundo cometeremos de forma coordinada un placebocidio homeopático (del que ya hemos hablado aquí) para llamar la atención sobre el asunto y sensibilizar a la opinión pública de que la homeopatía no sólo no funciona sino que no es posible que funcione. De este modo, el objetivo más importante es animar tanto a consumidores como a médicos y farmacéuticos para que recurran a los medicamentos que realmente han demostrado efectos (positivos) en la salud de los pacientes.\nBuscando las palabras perfectas para iniciar este post recordé este tweet del buen Borja Robert. Últimamente siempre me sucede lo mismo, investigo en las fuentes apropiadas (para mi) para cada tema concreto y encuentro que siempre llego tarde (o siempre otros llegan antes) y las palabras apropiadas ya se encuentran a disposición del público. Como apunte final a esta especie de disculpa por ser tan breve e infrecuente, dado que el público de este blog no tiene por qué leer los sitios que yo leo (ni falta que hace), no viene mal repetir ciertos textos si éstos lo merecen. Me veo por ello obligado a dejarles dos párrafos de un genial artículo de Steven Novella (presentador habitual del podcast semanal The Skeptics Guide to the Universe, que tanto lamento no haber reseñado aún).\n The 1023 campaign is a UK based organization whose purpose is to raise awareness of the actual claims of homeopathy. The name is a reference to Avogadro’s number (6.02214179×10^23), which is the number of atoms or molecules of a substance in one unit called a mole. This is an important basic concept in chemistry, for it means that there are a finite number of bits of a substance in any solution, which further means that solutions cannot be infinitely diluted. You cannot have fractions of a molecule of any substance. There is therefore a dilutional limit – a point beyond which if you further dilute a solution you are increasingly likely to have removed all of the original substance. Homeopathic preparations frequently use serial dilutions that vastly exceed this dilutional limit. This is a central fallacy of homeopathy (what homeopaths call a “law” of homeopathy). Samuel Hahnemann, who invented the fiction of homeopathy, knew about the dilutional limit but believed that substances gave their magical essence to water when diluted. Modern homeopaths believe this too, but in order to make their nonsense more marketable to a 21st century culture a tad more used to science (or at least scientific jargon) than Hahnemann’s, they have desperately tried to wrap “ magical essence” in sciencey technobabble. [...]  Les dejo con la nota de prensa publicada a nivel nacional. Si desean colaborar o participar pueden contactar con la organización o si les resulta más cómodo incluso conmigo que estoy (y estaré el próximo día 5) muy próximo a ellos.\n “Sobredosis” homeopáticas contra la homeopatía Activistas por los derechos de los consumidores de toda España han anunciado hoy su intención de “ suicidarse” tomando una “ sobredosis” de homeopatía como parte de una protesta masiva global contra estos remedios alternativos. El 5 de febrero, manifestantes en varias ciudades españolas ingerirán cajas enteras de pastillas homeopáticas para sensibilizar a la opinión pública de que los remedios homeopáticos son completamente ineficaces y, además, presionar a farmacéuticos y otros agentes sanitarios a garantizar que los productos que venden como tratamientos médicos realmente funcionen. Fernando Frías, portavoz del grupo, comenta: “La mayoría de la gente no sabe que las pastillas homeopáticas no son remedios naturales, que no están hechos con plantas medicinales. De hecho, incluso los homeópatas reconocen que sus pastillas no contienen nada más que agua y azúcar. Estamos organizando esta protesta para mostrar que estas -mal llamadas- medicinas no tienen ninguna utilidad y, por tanto, no deberían formar parte del tratamiento médico de nadie. Ni homeópatas ni farmacéuticos deberían estar vendiendo estos medicamentos falsos a personas con enfermedades reales. Son una pérdida de tiempo y de dinero”. La protesta la organizan distintos colectivos escépticos, racionalistas y de defensa de los derechos de los consumidores en apoyo de la Campaña 10:23 1, una protesta global contra los remedios homeopáticos originada en el Reino Unido. Eventos similares se desarrollarán simultáneamente en más de una decena de países alrededor del mundo; entre otros, Estados Unidos, Alemania, Australia, Holanda, Bélgica, Hungría, Argentina o Canadá. Michael Marshall, coordinador de la campaña internacional, dijo “Queremos demostrar que existe una sensación creciente de que ya se han invertido demasiado tiempo y dinero en los remedios homeopáticos. En los 200 años de existencia de estos tratamientos nunca ha habido ningún tipo de evidencia de que puedan funcionar, y, porque no son más que azúcar y agua, es imposible que puedan hacer lo que los homeópatas afirman que hacen. Se gastan miles de millones de euros anuales en estos tratamientos ineficaces y, cuando se dice lo que realmente son, y cómo se fabrican, la mayoría de la gente se sorprende de que sigan vendiéndose a un público no adecuadamente informado”. La Campaña 10:23 se lanzó hace un año en el Reino Unido, con casi 400 manifestantes tomando parte en sobredosis homeopáticas por todo el país protestando por las declaraciones de la principal cadena de farmacias británica, Boots, que justificó la venta de pastillas homeopáticas “porque los clientes las compran, no porque sean eficaces”. La campaña recibe su nombre del número de Avogadro, una constante científica que expresa el número de moléculas existentes en un mol de cualquier sustancia y que sirve para demostrar que muchas pociones homeopáticas no contienen principio activo alguno, y que las que lo contienen lo hacen en unas dosis tan bajas que nunca pueden producir ningún efecto. Aunque algunos puedan argumentar que no hay nada de peligroso en dispensar pastillas de azúcar, que farmacéuticos o personal sanitario avalen la eficacia de los tratamientos homeopáticos acarrea graves consecuencias. Además de minar la confianza de la opinión pública en los servicios sanitarios, se puede animar a pacientes con enfermedades graves a buscar en la homeopatía una alternativa a la atención médica real. Un triste ejemplo es el de Gloria Sam, de sólo nueve meses, que murió en 2002 a causa de las infecciones provocadas por un eccema que sus padres decidieron tratar con homeopatía. Recientemente, una investigación llevada a cabo por la BBC ha mostrado a homeópatas que intentaban suministrar a viajeros sus ineficaces preparaciones para usarlas como sustituto de medicamentos reales contra la malaria, e, incluso, ofrecían alternativas homeopáticas a las vacunas. El Reto 10:23 pretende conseguir el apoyo de más de 1023 ciudadanos en más de 10 países y 23 ciudades durante el 5 de febrero de 2011.

En función del éxito que coseche el piloto hay unos cuantos guiones para hacer una temporada completa de reportajes.\nJose A. Pérez es entre otras cosas el autor del blog Mi Mesa Cojea y creador de la serie Ciudad K para RTVE. Luis A. Gámez es periodista de El Correo, autor del blog Magonia y miembro fundador de Círculo Escéptico, también entre otras muchas cosas. Además han creado un blog en el que hemos podido seguir (y seguiremos) el rodaje, Mi rodaje cojea.\nEste primer piloto tiene como tema la llegada del hombre a la Luna, tantas veces puesta en duda (no sin cierta imaginación en ocasiones) y tantas veces demostrada, aunque insuficientes a la vista de este reportaje. Hace poco nos reunimos en Madrid para discutir el asunto en una de las últimas ediciones del año 2010 de Escépticos en el Pub, de la que ya hablé con motivo de la presentación del podcast Pensando Críticamente.\nAdemás de verlo en directo, ya está disponible el episodio piloto de Escépticos en alta calidad.

    "body": " Suicidas homeopáticos anuncian reto global Defensores de los derechos de los consumidores de todo el mundo están siendo convocados a participar en una sobredosis global de pastillas homeopáticas para concienciar a la opinión pública de la manifiesta ineficacia de estos remedios.\nEl Reto 10:23 (10:23 Challenge), cuya culminación mundial está prevista para febrero de 2011, es la continuación de la protesta llevada a cabo por la Campaña 10:23 (10:23 Campaign) en el Reino Unido, que supuso que cerca de 400 manifestantes salieran a la calle para hacer patente su preocupación por la venta de estas pastillas en grandes farmacias como Boots y el apoyo a estos tratamientos por parte del sistema sanitario público británico.\nMichael Marshall, de la Campaña 10:23, ha explicado los planes para 2011: “Este ha sido un gran año en Reino Unido para la sensibilización pública sobre la homeopatía, con médicos, farmacéuticos, políticos y, sobre todo, ciudadanos de cualquier procedencia levantando su voz contra este tratamiento totalmente desacreditado”1.\n“Sin embargo, la preocupación por la homeopatía se extiende más allá del Reino Unido. Por todo el mundo hay ciudadanos que reciben el mensaje de que la homeopatía es un remedio eficaz, a menudo con trágicas consecuencias. Es un problema global que requiere acciones globales”.\n“Esta es la razón por la que anunciamos el ‘Reto 10:23’ para 2011. Queremos mostrar la unidad global ante este problema con participantes de más de 10 países y más de 23 ciudades. Nuestro objetivo es conseguir que más de 1023 personas se reúnan durante el fin de semana del 5 y 6 de febrero para demostrar que La homeopatía, ni cura ni nada.”\n“Por supuesto, la seguridad es nuestra principal preocupación. No todos los remedios homeopáticos se preparan tan honesta y limpiamente como sus productores dicen, y algunos pueden incluir ingredientes reales que pueden ser potencialmente peligrosos. Siendo conscientes de esta situación, animamos a cualquier ciudadano que quiera participar a preparar sus propios remedios homeopáticos, o a ponerse en contacto con los organizadores para recibir más información (1023es@gmail.com o contact@1023.org.uk)”.\nAunque la participación internacional aún está pendiente de ser anunciada, el reto culminará con una concentración en Manchester el 6 de febrero, durante la conferencia QED2, con más de 300 personas participando en la manifestación local contra la homeopatía más multitudinaria que se haya hecho hasta ahora.\nLa Campaña 10:233 es un movimiento internacional dirigido por la Sociedad Escéptica de Merseyside4 que pretende sensibilizar a la opinión pública sobre qué es la homeopatía: una industria multimillonaria basada en unos rituales del siglo XVIII totalmente desacreditados desde hace décadas. Esta industria vende a los ciudadanos unos ‘tratamientos’ sin fundamento científico alguno y sin ningún tipo de evidencia creíble acerca de su eficacia más allá del efecto placebo.\nA pesar de que suministrar pastillas de azúcar pueda parecer inocuo, en realidad el apoyo a pociones homeopáticas por parte de los servicios y profesionales sanitarios puede acarrear gravísimas consecuencias. En septiembre de 2010, un investigador de la BBC descubrió a varios homeópatas registrados administrando ‘alternativas’ ineficaces de la vacuna triple vírica5, y, en 2009, Gloria Sam, una niña de sólo 9 meses, murió a causa de severas infecciones porque su eczema –una enfermedad habitualmente tratada por homeópatas- fue tratado con remedios homeopáticos6.\nMichael Marshall concluye: “La homeopatía ha tenido más de dos siglos para demostrar su eficacia como tratamiento, pero los resultados siempre han sido negativos. Mientras tanto, hay gente a la que están engañando para creer que estas pastillas funcionan, en muchas ocasiones causando auténtico daño. Consideramos que esto es totalmente inaceptable, y el 5 de febrero vamos a demostrarlo públicamente”.\nPara más información sobre el Reto 10:23 visita http://1023.org.uk.

(y las madres que lo parieron...) Cada vez resulta más frecuente encontrar en los medios de comunicación noticias llamativas sobre clonación o manipulación genética de seres vivos, ya sean animales o plantas. Todo el mundo opina, generalmente en contra, sobre alimentos que llevan ingredientes manipulados genéticamente. Sin embargo, poco es lo que se sabe sobre el método y las posibles consecuencias de estas manipulaciones. El Profesor José Antonio López Guerrero – Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (UAM-CSIC)– pretende dar una visión, forzosamente general, de los aspectos principales sobre la transgénesis de organismos –empezando por la elección del título tan poco ortodoxo. Partiendo de la descripción de los métodos actuales de elaboración de organismos transgénicos, se repasará la legislación vigente, aplicaciones clínicas e investigación básica de esta herramienta, tanto en modificación genética de animales como de plantas, concluyendo con la enumeración de un selecto número de ejemplos. Por supuesto, el autor dará su visión personal –e intransferible, como el bonobus- del potencial que dicha técnica tendría para investigación y biotecnología –de campo o en confinamiento-. En el debate posterior, se podrá discutir sobre la prensa, generalmente desfavorable, que la técnica presenta a través de algunos medios...

Es ciencia ficción, no precisamente normal, pero tiene suficientes dosis de humor, acción y aventura para que pueda gustarle a cualquiera. No suele defraudar, te puede encantar o simplemente gustarte, pero la gente siempre suele agradecer la recomendación. Debería dedicar otra entrada exclusivamente a la serie.\nMy own kind of freedom  My own kind of freedom es un fan fiction no oficial de Steven Brust. El autor tiene publicadas bastantes novelas, pero esta vez decidió publicar el relato en descarga gratuita con una licencia Creative Commons, supongo que por no pelear temas legales.\nEl relato tiene una estructura similar a cualquier capítulo de la serie, de hecho el gran conocimiento del autor hace que pudiese encajar perfectamente como capítulo intermedio entre la serie y la película. En este caso narra las desventuras de la tripulación de la nave Serenity cuando uno de sus negocios se tuerce en el planeta Hera. No profundizaré en la trama, el relato es corto y cualquier interesado debería leerlo.\nSí que me gustaría comentar la forma en que está escrito. Sin salir de la visión en tercera persona, el libro está dividido en pequeños capítulos centrados cada vez en uno de los personajes. Esto hace que puedas centrar la atención y describir lo que hace o piensa ese personaje, y siendo un homenaje a la serie original resulta muy curioso ver el desarrollo de los mismos. Veo perfectamente reflejados a todos los personajes, desde sus actos a sus expresiones, salvo quizá en momentos a Malcolm Reynolds (el Capitán, interpretado por Nathan Fillion).\nEn definitiva recomendable, una delicia especialmente para fans de la serie. Es un capitulo más, con las ventajas y desventajas de desarrollarse en tu imaginación.\nDebo volver a agradecer a Angela que me lo recomendara en su momento.\n",

    "title": "Manifiesto por una Universidad libre de pseudociencia y oscurantismo",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "  (Este manifiesto ha sido redactado por La Ciencia y sus Demonios)  Ante la cada vez más abundante proliferación de conferencias, cursos, seminarios y todo tipo de actividades que diferentes corrientes pseudocientíficas están desarrollando dentro del marco de las universidades españolas y latinoamericanas, tendencia que cristaliza en la reciente creación de una Cátedra de Investigación sobre Homeopatía en la Universidad de Zaragoza, los abajo firmantes (científicos, profesores, alumnos y ciudadanos en general) nos vemos en la necesidad de manifestar lo siguiente:\nLa colaboración entre la Universidad y la Empresa, así como con otros organismos y agentes sociales es enriquecedora, productiva y debe ser considerada como una de las prioridades de la política universitaria. Los acuerdos y contratos para la transferencia de resultados de la investigación a la empresa privada pueden representar una importante fuente de financiación para las universidades públicas; los cuales, desarrollados convenientemente, permiten una mayor productividad científica y la optimización de las aplicaciones de tal actividad. Sin embargo, creemos que no es justificable que la Universidad busque vías de financiación a cualquier precio, y aún menos si con ello pervierte su filosofía y fines fundamentales.\nLa Universidad Pública, como cualquier otro organismo de la administración, debe estar al servicio del ciudadano, manteniendo un contacto permanente con la sociedad de la que forma parte, mediante una comunicación constante que permita la sintonía entre el mundo universitario y las necesidades sociales. Para cumplir estos objetivos, la Universidad debe ser un adalid en lo referente a innovación y a exploración de nuevos caminos para el conocimiento. La Universidad nunca debe ser una estatua, sino una animación en constante movimiento.\nNo es posible entender la función investigadora y el compromiso social de la Universidad sin la imbricación con su papel fundamental en la formación de ciudadanos libres, capaces de enfrentarse al mundo mediante una mentalidad crítica que les permita escapar de las cadenas de la irracionalidad, la superstición y la ignorancia. Esta función docente, completamente consustancial a la institución universitaria, va más allá de las aulas, al representar la Universidad un referente en cuanto a conocimiento y racionalidad para toda la sociedad.\nEn este sentido, la Universidad juega un papel muy importante ante el avance que en la sociedad contemporánea están teniendo determinadas corrientes anticientíficas y antirracionales, que pueden suponer un significativo retroceso hacia el oscurantismo y la superstición, algo que se encuentra en el polo opuesto de los objetivos universitarios. Nos preocupa, como universitarios y como ciudadanos, que bien entrado el siglo XXI cada vez prolifere un mayor número de terapias más próximas a la magia que a la medicina, en muchas ocasiones amparadas por instituciones y empresas médicas profesionales; nos preocupa que presidentes de gobierno consulten astrólogos; que pulseras mágicas declaradas oficialmente fraudulentas sean portadas por ministros de sanidad y constituyan el regalo más vendido de las últimas navidades; que cada vez haya más ciudadanos que crean firmemente que las vacunas son tóxicas y nefastas para la salud; que aumente el número de enfermos que abandonan el tratamiento médico para abrazar alternativas esotéricas; nos preocupa muy seriamente que gran parte de la población vuelva a confiar más en los curanderos que en la medicina científica.\nNos preocupa que la Universidad pueda convertirse en un mercadillo que de cabida a cualquier alternativa irracional al conocimiento científico. Sólo una mal entendida apertura de mentalidad puede justificar que se enseñe alquimia en las Facultades de Química, ufología en las de Física o el diluvio universal en las de Historia. Ofrecer el foro universitario a las pseudociencias, en igualdad de condiciones con el conocimiento racional, no se traduce en ningún enriquecimiento cultural, sino en una validación universitaria de la superstición y la charlatanería. Difícilmente podremos educar a nuestros hijos sobre la inexistencia de bases empíricas en la predicción astrológica si van a encontrar en el campus universitario cursos de postgrado en astrología.\nReza una de las máximas en ciencia que la razón no debe aceptar algo como cierto sólo porque lo afirme mucha gente o porque lo suscriban personajes importantes, y que siempre es necesario detenerse ante cualquier afirmación y dudar sobre si es o no cierta. Esto obliga a actuar mucho más despacio, a sopesar cuidadosamente las opciones, a avanzar con cautela ante cualquier tipo de propuesta. Y esta es una de las cosas que creemos firmemente que debe enseñarse en las universidades.\nPor todo ello, nos preocupa que la Universidad de cabida a cursos sobre acupuntura, a conferencias sobre creacionismo, a seminarios sobre astrología y a cátedras sobre homeopatía. Nos preocupa especialmente si no se enfocan como un debate crítico y un análisis racional, sino con un presupuesto de funcionalidad y validación científica de los que no sólo carecen, sino que están en frontal oposición al espíritu crítico universitario.\nEn el caso concreto de la homeopatía, aunque de igual aplicación para el resto de pseudociencias, no se ha demostrado científicamente ni su fundamento teórico (que contradice nuestros conocimientos sobre química y medicina más elementales), ni su efectividad más allá de un placebo. Décadas atrás, se destinaron importantes estudios a buscar una posible base en los postulados homeopáticos, los cuales no han variado significativamente en doscientos años, base que jamás se encontró.\nNos resulta extremadamente paradójico que mientras gobiernos europeos retiran fondos y apoyos estatales a la práctica homeopática, en España se instauren cátedras dentro de las universidades públicas. El aval que esto supone, sitúa a la homeopatía, a la astrología o al espiritismo dentro de la categoría de disciplinas universitarias; máxime cuando no nos encontramos exclusivamente ante una actividad de investigación sobre un fenómeno dudoso, sino ante una institucionalización dirigida a la formación y divulgación de estos postulados.\nConsideramos por último, que si bien está justificado profundizar y destinar fondos a cualquier aspecto que pueda ser investigado, la especial situación económica actual convierte la inversión de esfuerzo y medios en este tipo de disciplinas totalmente desacreditadas en un acto de puro despilfarro de recursos, que podrían emplearse en líneas de investigación y docencia muchísimo más prioritarias.\nLas personas que desde distintos estamentos y colectivos de la sociedad suscribimos este manifiesto, deseamos llamar la atención sobre este importante aspecto al conjunto de la población y, especialmente, a las autoridades académicas y gubernativas, confiando en que la razón acabe imponiéndose sobre la superstición y el oscurantismo.\n FIRMAR EL MANIFIESTO  (Vía La Ciencia y sus Demonios)\n",

    "body": " Mañana, se puede decir que en cuestión de horas, salgo hacia Londres. Por tercera vez en menos de dos años aunque esta vez no es por motivos turísticos.\nEl motivo de este viaje es asistir a la TAM London 2010, un evento único y muy especial. TAM viene de ‘The Amaz!ng Meeting’, unas jornadas de eventos y conferencias organizadas por la JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation) habitualmente en Las Vegas aunque desde 2009 se vienen desdoblando aquí en Europa, en Londres hasta ahora.\nDurante dos días (espero que con sus tres noches) conoceré, charlaré, escucharé y aprenderé de más de mil asistentes, entre ellos grandes genios como:\n Richard Dawkins (Wikipedia) James Randi (Wikipedia) Alan Moore (Wikipedia) PZ Myers (Wikipedia) Graham Linehan (Wikipedia) Andy Nyman (Wikipedia) Cory Doctorow (Wikipedia) Adam Rutherford Robin Ince (Wikipedia) Susan Blackmore (Wikipedia) Richard Wiseman (Wikipedia) Tim Minchin (Wikipedia) Marcus Chown (Wikipedia) DJ Grothe (Wikipedia) Melinda Gebbie (Wikipedia) Stephen Fry (finalmente por videoconferencia) (Wikipedia) Evan Harris (Wikipedia) Gia Milinovich (Wikipedia) Simon Singh (Wikipedia) Rebecca Watson (Wikipedia) Jack of Kent Tracy Brown Karen James ...  Las charlas estarán disponibles en vídeo después del evento, pero creo que merece la pena disfrutar en vivo tanto de las conferencias como del tiempo entre ellas. Vean un resumen del evento del año pasado:\n   Como plato fuerte del sábado noche disfrutaremos del inagotable Tim Minchin, y la premiere mundial de su poema animado Storm (twitter de Storm), en formato película. Os dejo con el trailer:\n   Para aquellos que queráis saber más del evento durante el mismo: el podcast oficial de la TAM London es Little Atoms; el blogger oficial será Martin Robbins de Lay Science, que irá retransmitiendo el evento en directo; la Fotógrafo oficial es Kelly Haddow.\nSi las condiciones técnicas lo permiten, tengo intención de ir publicando fotos y comentarios durante el fin de semana, trataré de escribir bastante sobre ello a la vuelta. La ocasión lo merece.\n",

    "body": " Esta misma mañana he tenido ocasión de participar en el World Bike Tour Madrid 2010, un multitudinario paseo en bicicleta por el centro de la ciudad que se celebra por tercer año aquí en Madrid. La organización corre a cargo de Sportis (una compañía portuguesa dedicada a eventos deportivos) con la ayuda en su edición madrileña del Ayuntamiento de Madrid y el Ministerio de Salud y Política Social. Dado el origen luso, este evento se celebra también en Lisboa, Oporto y São Paulo.\nHay varios eventos similares, al menos aquí en Madrid. Lo que hace a éste especial es que con la inscripción te regalan la bicicleta, el casco, una mochila ciclista y cierto avituallamiento, además de dos camisetas y algo de merchandising de los patrocinadores. La cuota es algo alta para un paseo de pocos kilómetros (70 € este año) pero compensa con creces lo obtenido. No se engañen, el equipo es bastante bueno pero el precio en parte está subvencionado por los patrocinadores. Como agradecimiento mencionaré a los principales: edp renovavéis, galp, Turismo de Portugal y El Corte Inglés.\nLa ruta era bastante atractiva, unos 12 kilómetros desde Retiro a Casa de Campo pasando por la Gran Vía para conmemorar su centenario. En detalle ha sido: Paseo de Coches del Parque del Retiro, O`Donell, Alcalá, Plaza de la Independencia (Puerta de Alcalá), Plaza de Cibeles, Gran Vía, Plaza de España, cuesta de San Vicente, Puerta del Rey y casa de Campo, con llegada junto al Lago. He subido a Google Maps el track obtenido en mi móvil con MyTracks.\n  Ver World Bike Tour 2010 en un mapa más grande  Quizá por la densidad de puntos en el tracking, Google Maps lo dividide en varias etapas, y en el objeto enbebido sólo se muestra la primera parte del recorrido, pulsad el enlace para ver el resto del recorrido. Tengo la densidad al máximo porque me viene bien para mis labores de edición en OpenStreetMap.\n 2010-10-10 World Bike Tour 03 by Luiyo, on Flickr   El recorrido no era en absoluto duro, y es una auténtica delicia pasear en bicicleta por Alcalá, Cibeles o Gran Vía. Siendo un Domingo a las nueve de la mañana no había muchos peatones, pero era curioso ver la reacción de la gente al ver pasar a unos 5.000 ciclistas todos con las mismas bicicletas (aunque había 2-3 colores), casco, camiseta, etc. El frío a primera hora hacía que mucha gente se abrigase más, pero predominaba la camiseta de la organización aunque fuese por encima de otras prendas, como fue mi caso. Como nota curiosa, un grupo bastante grande de turistas en la puerta de un hotel en Gran Vía nos aplaudieron entusiasmados, quizá para entrar en calor hasta que llegase su autocar que estaría atrapado en algún corte de tráfico hasta que pasasen todos los ciclistas.\n 2010-10-10 World Bike Tour 04 by Luiyo, on Flickr   Una experiencia totalmente recomendable, por el paseo y en este caso especialmente por la oportunidad de conseguir una buena bicicleta de montaña y el equipo básico por un precio bajísimo.\nAprovechando que finalmente ha salido el Sol mi regreso a casa ha sido también en bicicleta, cruzando la Casa de Campo y parte del Anillo Verde Ciclista, en un recorrido algo más duro que el oficial y no tan pintoresco pero igual de interesante y recomendable para cualquier fin de semana.\n",

    "title": "Kiva, préstamos que cambian vidas",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Encontré la web de Kiva hace unos meses. En aquel momento me interesó mucho pero no me decidí y el tiempo y mi memoria enterraron la idea. Esta vez no podía pasar lo mismo.\nKiva es una organización sin ánimo de lucro, y su misión es facilitar la llegada de capital del primer al tercer mundo a través de organizaciones locales de cada país. Tal y como dice su web, Kiva nació con las siguientes creencias:\n La gente es generosa por naturaleza, y lo demuestra siempre que tiene una manera fiable y transparente de hacerlo. Podemos motivar enormemente a la gente más pobre del planeta para que tengan éxito en su vida. Se pueden crear relaciones más allá de las transacciones financieras, contribuyendo a formar una comunidad global en la que apoyarnos y animarnos unos a otros.  Con las que estoy totalmente de acuerdo. Para conseguirlo, Kiva funciona del siguiente modo:\n Primero Kiva se encarga de llegar a acuerdos con instituciones que proporcionan microcréditos en países pobres. Estas organizaciones locales nos cuentan a través de Kiva los préstamos que han realizado, la historia que hay detrás, etc. Los usuarios de todo el mundo navegan entre las múltiples historias y proyectos y eligen a quién financiar con su dinero. Kiva entrega el dinero recaudado a la organización local. El emprendedor devuelve a la organización local el dinero que se le prestó en su momento, a su vez la organización local devuelve a Kiva lo que corresponda. Kiva devuelve al usuario el dinero que entregó, y éste decide si lo vuelve a prestar o lo recupera.    A Fistful Of Dollars: The Story of a Kiva.org Loan from Kieran \u0026amp; Hollie Harrington-Ball on Vimeo  Miles de personas necesitadas consiguen mejorar o sacar adelante sus vidas, sus negocios, sus familias, etc. de una forma rentable. Del mismo modo, muchos otros miles de personas del primer mundo consiguen ayudar de una forma digna y transparente. Os dejo las cifras (actualizadas anoche):\n   Total value of all loans made through Kiva: $164,549,800   Number of Kiva Users: 765,848   Number of Kiva Users who have funded a loan: 486,122   Number of countries represented by Kiva Lenders: 207   Number of entrepreneurs that have received a loan through Kiva: 426,719   Number of loans that have been funded through Kiva: 225,429   Percentage of Kiva loans which have been made to women entrepreneurs: 82.00%   Number of Kiva Field Partners (microfinance institutions Kiva partners with): 120   Number of countries Kiva Field Partners are located in: 54   Current repayment rate (all partners): 98.91%   Average loan size (This is the average amount loaned to an individual Kiva Entrepreneur. Some loans - group loans - are divided between a group of borrowers.): $382.28    Average total amount loaned per Kiva Lender (includes reloaned funds): $214.69   Average number of loans per Kiva Lender: 6.33    Para conseguir estas cifras, Kiva se sirve de una página bastante sencilla que permite navegar entre los proyectos con información clara y extensa tanto de la persona o personas que reciben el préstamo, como de la organización mediante la que llegará el dinero o el país en el que se encuentra. En el caso de las organizaciones, se realiza un cuidadoso estudio y control para impedir que los préstamos no lleguen a su destino, o no vuelvan tras ser reembolsados por los emprendedores. Evidentemente no es lo habitual, pero previene problemas que siempre surgen.\nKiva tiene acuerdos con varios patrocinadores, en algunos casos para igualar las aportaciones realizadas. También cuenta con un sistema de recomendaciones, de forma que si los nuevos usuarios indican en su alta quién les informó del sitio se producen donaciones adicionales. Si están interesados pueden pedirme más información por correo.\nSinceramente, no me ha costado nada desprenderme de un dinero que me habría gastado con una facilidad pasmosa saliendo esta noche a tomar algo. Quizá en el futuro invierta en esto más dinero y desde luego lo que me reintegren volverá a destinarse a otro proyecto diferente.\nMis primeros apoyos han ido finalmente a María Parra de Perú y a Livinston Mosquera de Ecuador.\nPara más información al respecto, y para evitar que vuestro dinero caiga en malas manos, os recomiendo la lectura de esta entrada de Rinze (Kiva sin religión), que evidentemente ha sido mi referer\nPor cierto, sirva la presente entrada para celebrar que Luiyología ha cumplido siete años.\n",

    "title": "Reseña de Guillotine",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Me parece mentira que hasta ahora no haya escrito en el blog ninguna reseña de un juego de mesa, siendo una de mis principales aficiones. Eso tiene que cambiar, y con la reseña de Guillotine espero inaugurar una de las secciones más prolíficas, comentadas y visitadas.\nPortada de Guillotine  Ficha básica:   Título:   Guillotine   Autor:   Paul Peterson   Año de Publicación:   1998   Publicado por:   Wizards of the Coast   Número de jugadores:   2-5   Duración estimada:   30 minutos   Dependencia del idioma:   Moderada   Categoría:   Juego de cartas   Historia de fondo: Heads are going to roll —lots of them— and you want to earn top bragging rights back in the guillotine operator's locker room. If you behead Marie Antoinette or King Louis XVI everyone will be impress, but who's going to care if you lop off a palace guard's head? So make sure you collect the most prestigious noggings and you'll be head and shoulders above the rest! Componentes: 2010-09-26 Guillotine 02 Componentes by Luiyo, on Flickr   Dentro de la caja, de reducidas dimensiones, podemos encontrar 50 cartas de Nobles y 60 cartas de Acción. En la edición que yo tengo viene un verdugo para indicar el principio de la fila, no es imprescindible para el juego, aunque lo hace más vistoso y cómodo. 2010-09-26 Guillotine 04 Verdugo by Luiyo, on Flickr  Objetivo del juego: Guillotine es una competición entre verdugos para ver quién se hace con las cabezas más valiosas en su cesta. Serán tres días de ejecuciones, y en cada uno de ellos se pondrán inicialmente 12 nobles en fila. Al final de los tres días, el jugador con más puntos gana la partida.\nEn este juego el término noble aplica a todo aquel que se encuentre en la fila, aunque realmente sólo un subconjunto de ellos se correspondería con lo que solemos entender por Nobleza. El valor de cada noble viene indicado en la carta, siendo valores entre -3 y 5, los negativos son para víctimas inocentes que son ejecutadas. Los nobles se pueden dividir en:\n Con fondo morado, la Nobleza. 2010-09-26 Guillotine 09 Nobleza by Luiyo, on Flickr  Con fondo rojo, el poder militar. 2010-09-26 Guillotine 08 Poder Militar by Luiyo, on Flickr  Con fondo verde, el poder civil. 2010-09-26 Guillotine 10 Poder Civil by Luiyo, on Flickr  Con fondo azul, el poder eclesiástico. 2010-09-26 Guillotine 11 Poder eclesiástico by Luiyo, on Flickr  Con fondo gris, víctimas inocentes, 2010-09-26 Guillotine 12 Inocentes by Luiyo, on Flickr   El turno consiste, para cada jugador, en:\n Jugar una carta de acción. Guillotinar al noble que se encuentre el primero en la fila. Robar una carta de acción.  Las cartas de acción ofrecen muchas posibilidades, podemos alterar el orden de un noble adelantando o atrasando su posición, alterar la fila añadiendo, eliminando o reordenando nobles, jugando contra otros jugadores para que pierdan puntos, nobles o cartas, sumar bonificaciones según el tipo de noble que guillotinemos, etc.\nAlgunos personajes tienen características especiales: permiten robar una carta de acción adicional, por fidelidad de sus fieles tras ser guillotinados se añade un noble al final de la fila (como el General), proporcionan puntos extra en combinación con otros nobles (como el Count y la Countess que valen el doble si van al mismo cesto o los Palace Guard que valen un punto por cada Palace Guard que tengas), permiten ejecutar nobles adicionales (como el Fast Noble o el Rival Executioner), etc. Guillotinar a Robespierre hace que el día termine inmediatamente, dejando al resto de nobles en la fila sin ejecutar.\nEjemplos de juego: 2010-09-26 Guillotine 17 Ejemplo 1 by Luiyo, on Flickr  En este primer ejemplo una jugada clara, si tenemos carta para ello, consiste en adelantar al Cardenal, para poder obtener una cabeza de 5 puntos en lugar de una que nos resta 1.\n2010-09-26 Guillotine 18 Ejemplo 2 by Luiyo, on Flickr  Este caso podría parecer una situación parecida pero no lo es. El segundo noble es el Fast Noble, que obliga a guillotinar también al siguiente noble de la fila. Si adelantásemos el Fast Noble o retrasásemos el Hero of the People nos llevaríamos las dos cabezas, siendo al final una mala jugada. En lugar de eso tendríamos que descartar al Fast Noble, retrasarlo dos o más posiciones, o alterar de algún otro modo la fila.\nConclusión: Guillotine es un muy buen juego, apto para todo tipo de jugadores. Con una rápida explicación cualquiera podrá jugar y disfrutar del mismo, y basta una partida de prueba para que un jugador conozca las posibilidades de las acciones y los nobles y pueda ser totalmente competitivo. Aunque se puede jugar hasta con 5 jugadores, el juego es especialmente bueno y divertido para dos personas, permitiendo combos y contraataques más fácilmente.\nLa dependencia del idioma es bastante baja. Hay textos en algunas cartas y personajes, pero nada complicado, las posibilidades son conocidas y hay dibujos explicativos. Para alguien con nulos conocimientos del inglés bastaría con una chuleta al lado con los significados resumidos de cada carta, que solo necesitaría mirar un poco al principio.\nAl igual que pasa en otros juegos, los títulos e ilustraciones de las cartas están trabajados y son muy graciosos.\nMi calificación, según los criterios de Board Game Geek es un 8.\n",

    "title": "El Cisne Negro, de Nassim Nicholas Taleb",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Hace unos días terminé de leer El Cisne Negro, el impacto de lo altamente improbable, de Nassim Nicholas Taleb, uno de los libros más interesantes que he leído recientemente.\nNNT, como el autor se llama a si mismo, es un libanés afincado en Estados Unidos interesado estudioso de múltiples géneros, destacando entre ellos la probabilidad, el azar y la incertidumbre. Hace años se ganó (parece que muy bien) la vida como analista de bolsa. Ahora vive de la venta de sus libros, de sus charlas como divulgador científico y de su puesto como Profesor del Instituto Politécnico de la Universidad de Nueva York.\nEl Cisne Negro, en una mezcla de ensayo filosófico y matemático, nos cuenta de forma relativamente amena (para el tema que se trata) los problemas que tenemos hoy en día para predecir el futuro. Para ello utiliza múltiples referencias, ejemplos y metáforas. Especialmente destacable la que figura en el Prólogo y da título al libro:\nAntes del descubrimiento de Australia, las personas del Viejo Mundo estaban convencidas de que todos los cisnes eran blancos, una creencia irrefutable pues parecía que las pruebas empíricas la confirmaban en su totalidad. La visión del primer cisne negro pudo ser una sorpresa interesante para unos pocos ornitólogos (y otras personas de mucho interés por el color de las aves), pero la importancia de la historia no radica aquí. Este hecho ilustra una grave limitación de nuestro aprendizaje a partir de la observación o la experiencia, y la fragilidad de nuestro conocimiento. Una sola observación puede invalidar una afirmación generalizada derivada de milenios de visiones confirmatorias de millones de cisnes blancos. Todo lo que se necesita es una sola (y, por lo que dicen, fea) ave negra.\nDoy un paso adelante, dejando atrás esta cuestión lógico-filosófica, para entrar en la realidad empírica, la cual me obsesiona desde niño. Lo que aquí llamamos un Cisne Negro (así, en mayúsculas) es un suceso con los tres atributos que siguen.\nPrimero, es una rareza, pues habita fuera del reino de las expectativas normales, porque nada del pasado puede apuntar de forma convincente a su posibilidad. Segundo, produce un impacto tremendo. Tercero, pese a su condición de rareza, la naturaleza humana hace que inventemos explicaciones de su existencia después del hecho, con lo que se hace explicable y predecible.\n[...]  Así es. Lo que nos rodea está fuertemente influenciado (o directamente provocado) por Cisnes Negros. Podríamos nombrar varios: el principio de Arquímedes, la penicilina, el 11-S, la relevancia de Internet, etc. Fueron hechos de descubrimiento o aparición casual e inesperada que cambiaron tremendamente todo lo que ha sucedido a continuación.\nA pesar de la innegable existencia y efecto de los llamados Cisnes Negros, vivimos rodeados por un afán de predecirlo todo, tanto a nivel económico como social. Se acumulan los errores, y siempre hay alguien que encuentra (a posteriori) una explicación para lo que a priori era inexplicable y totalmente inesperado.\nLas predicciones actuales se basan en que siga pasando lo que ya está pasando, por ello el autor destaca la importancia de lo que no está pasando o no conocemos sobre lo que está realmente sucediendo. Cualquier intento por parte de un experto de predecir algo relativamente alejado en el tiempo debe ser expuesto y denunciado como una estafa. Podemos hacer proyecciones de los datos, pero no podemos predecir. Los datos conocidos cada vez son más irrelevantes.\nUno de los conceptos más claros, que Taleb utiliza de forma recurrente en el texto, es la diferencia entre dos países ficticios: Mediocristán y Extremistán. En Mediocristán las cosas no se salen mucho de la media y la aleatoriedad es moderada. La regla de oro en Mediocristán es Cuando la muestra es grande, ningún elemento singular cambiará de forma significativa el total. Pone varios ejemplos: juntamos a mil personas y el peso de la persona más gorda del mundo nunca afectará demasiado a la media ni al total. O el consumo de calorías anual, ningún día puede suponer un consumo de calorías significativo, aunque sea Navidad y nos pasemos el día comiendo, las calorías de ese día no afectarían demasiado al consumo anual. Podemos pensar también en los ingresos de un panadero, el número de accidentes de tráfico, etc.\nEn Extremistán sucede todo lo contrario. Juntemos otra vez a mil personas, entre ellas metamos a Bill Gates. En este caso la riqueza de Bill Gates podría suponer sin duda el 99% de la riqueza total de los presentes. Otros ejemplos serían el número de ventas de una novela, los daños producidos por un terremoto, el índice de inflación, etc. La lista de Extremistán sería mucho más larga.\nEn Youtube podemos encontrar una entrevista de Charlie Rose a Taleb sobre El Cisne Negro, en inglés con subtítulos en castellano.\nEn definitiva, aunque algunos tramos resultan demasiado técnicos y algo áridos (el autor nos lo indica para que podamos prescindir de esos capítulos) la lectura de este libro es bastante recomendable. Ayuda a ver las cosas desde una perspectiva diferente. Quizá le sobre cierto nivel de pretendida superioridad intelectual sobre cualquiera que siga otras directrices en el campo de la estadística.\nNo podemos evitar estar expuestos a los Cisnes Negros, yo mismo acabo de sufrir en persona un terrible Cisne Negro, pero podemos estar preparados y mentalizados para ello.\nTengo que agradecer a mi buen amigo Félix que me comentara y prestara este libro. Me ha venido bien ahora que estoy más que nunca expuesto a la incertidumbre y la aleatoriedad.\n",

    "title": "La pirámide, de Henning Mankell",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Henning Mankell es uno de mis autores de novela negra favoritos. De su serie sobre Kurt Wallander he leído casi todos, y estoy dispuesto a leer este verano los pocos que me faltan. Uno de ellos es éste.\nLa Pirámide es una colección de relatos cortos que nos presenta en una especie de precuela, aunque fue publicado en noveno lugar, los primeros años como policía del Inspector Wallander. El nombre del libro se debe al último de los relatos, el más interesante y complejo, que acontece justo antes de la que fue primera novela de Wallander Asesinos sin rostro.\nEl siguiente pasaje pertenece al inicio del primero de los relatos.\n[...] El joven Wallander residía en un viejo edificio de Rosengård. La manzana entera vivía bajo la constante amenaza de demolición. Pero a él le gustaba, aunque Mona ya le había advertido que, si se casaban, tendrían que trasladarse a otro barrio. El apartamento de Wallander constaba de una habitación, cocina y un baño minúsculo. Era su primera vivienda propia. Había adquirido los muebles en subastas y en distintos establecimientos de muebles usados. Fotografías con motivos florales o con islas paradisíacas adornaban las paredes y, puesto que su padre iba a verlo de vez en cuando, se había visto obligado a colgar también uno de sus paisajes sobre el sofá: uno sin urogallo.\nPero el elemento más importante de su hogar era el tocadiscos. Los pocos discos que tenía eran, principalmente, de ópera. Cuando recibía la visita de sus colegas, éstos solían preguntarle cómo podía escuchar aquello... De ahí que hubiese adquirido algunos discos con otro tipo de música, para ponerlos cuando tuviese invitados. Por alguna razón que a él se le ocultaba, los policías parecían ser entusiastas de Roy Orbison.\nPoco después de la una, tras el almuerzo, se tomó un café y adecentó el apartamento lo mejor que pudo mientras escuchaba a Jussi Björling. Era su primer disco y estaba tan rayado que era difícil poder escucharlo bien. Y, sin embargo, solía pensar que, si se declarase un incendio en el edificio, sería lo primero que se apresurase a salvar.\nAcababa de poner el disco por segunda vez cuando se oyeron unos violentos golpes en el techo que lo movieron a bajar el volumen. En aquella casa se oía todo. En el piso de arriba vivía una mujer jubilada, Linnea Almqvist, que había regentado una floristería. Cuando la mujer consideraba que su música sonaba demasiado alto, daba golpes en el suelo para que él, obediente, bajase el volumen. La ventana estaba abierta, la cortina que Mona había colgado se mecía al suave vaivén de la brisa y él se tumbó en la cama, relajado. Se sentía cansado e indolente. Tenía derecho a tomarse un descanso. Empezó a hojear un número de la revista Lektyr, que solía ocultar cuando Mona iba a visitarlo, pero no tardó en dejarla caer en el suelo, vencido por el agotamiento.\nLo arrancó del sueño un alarmante estrépito cuyo origen no fue capaz de precisar. Se levantó y fue a la cocina para ver si alguno de los enseres que allí tenía había caído al suelo, pero todo estaba en orden. Volvió entonces al dormitorio y miró por la ventana. El jardín que quedaba flanqueado por los edificios colindantes aparecía desierto. Un chándal de color azul pendía solitario de un tendedero y se agitaba, despacioso, al soplo de la brisa. Wallander volvió a tumbarse en la cama. Cuando despertó, fue para emerger de una ensoñación en la que aparecía la joven de la cafetería. Pero todo había sido impenetrable y caótico en aquel sueño.\nSe incorporó de nuevo y comprobó en el reloj que eran las cuatro menos cuarto. Había estado durmiendo durante más de dos horas. Se sentó ante la mesa de la cocina y escribió la lista de la compra. Mona le había prometido comprar algo de bebida en Copenhague. Se guardó el papel en el bolsillo, se puso la cazadora, salió y cerró la puerta tras de sí.\nPero, entonces, se detuvo un momento en la semipenumbra, pues se percató de que la puerta de su vecino estaba entreabierta. Aquello era bastante extraño, dado que el hombre que vivía en el apartamento contiguo era muy reservado y había hecho instalar una cerradura adicional hacía apenas un mes. Wallander consideró la posibilidad de marcharse pero, finalmente, decidió llamar a la puerta. El inquilino vivía solo en aquel apartamento; se llamaba Artur Hålén y era marino jubilado. Cuando Wallander se mudó, él ya habitaba allí. Solían saludarse y, de vez en cuando, si se encontraban por la escalera, intercambiaban unas frases banales, pero eso era todo. El joven Wallander había observado que Hålén jamás recibía una visita. Por las mañanas, el hombre escuchaba la radio; por las tardes, veía la televisión; pero, a las diez de la noche, no se oía ya el menor ruido en su apartamento. A Wallander se le había ocurrido pensar en alguna ocasión qué pensaría aquel hombre de las visitas femeninas que él recibía; y, en especial, cómo percibiría los sugerentes ruidos nocturnos. Sin embargo, y como era lógico, jamás se le había ocurrido preguntarle.\nEl joven agente llamó, pues, a la puerta una vez más, pero tampoco en esta ocasión recibió respuesta. Entonces la abrió y lo llamó en voz alta, sin obtener más respuesta que un profundo silencio. Accedió, vacilante, al vestíbulo, que despedía un denso olor a hombre mayor, a lugar cerrado. Una vez dentro, volvió a llamar.\n«Ha debido de olvidarse de cerrar con llave al salir», concluyó Wallander. «Después de todo, el hombre tiene más de setenta años y es normal que ande despistado.»\nEchó una ojeada a la cocina. Junto a una taza de café que había sobre el hule de la mesa, halló una quiniela arrugada. Después, apartó la cortina que separaba aquella dependencia de la habitación contigua y... un grito se escapó de su garganta. En efecto, Hålén yacía en el suelo, la blanca camisa empapada en sangre. Junto a la mano había un revólver.\n[...]  Los relatos siguen la línea de las anteriores novelas de Wallander, con la gracia esta vez de descubrir cómo se forjó el inspector. Aunque sin demasiado detalle, descubriremos como pasó de policía uniformado que patrullaba las calles de Malmö al departamento de Homicidios y posteriormente su traslado a Ystad. Del mismo modo, veremos brevemente el nacimiento de su relación con Mona, y cómo (y por qué) se va convirtiendo en esposa y finalmente ex-esposa.\nEn general no ofrece mucho detalle y estos relatos podrían ser posteriores con ligeros cambios. La situación en los momentos previos al resto de novelas se nota principalmente en la ingenuidad (de más a menos) del Inspector Wallander y la relevancia de los personajes que le rodean. A este respecto, eché mucho en falta más interacción entre Wallander y Rydberg, su mentor al que constantemente referencia en sus posteriores casos.\nEn definitiva, una gran opción para amantes de la novela negra y un buen comienzo para aquellos que quieran iniciarse.\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": " Acabo de terminar de leerlo y en este caso no demoro (ni olvido) la reseña ya que siento la necesidad de recomendar su lectura, ya que ha llegado a mi gracias a las sugerencias de dos buenos amigos (reseña de Pablo, reseña de Angela).\nHay varias cosas interesantes e inusuales en esta novela. La temática es altamente técnica y política, siendo la obra en cada uno de sus capítulos un gran alegato a las libertades civiles y al pensamiento crítico. Dicho esto, su lectura es bastante fácil y asequible para cualquier lector. No es nada fácil encontrar obras de este tipo que no sean extremadamente espesas o técnicamente inalcanzables para la mayoría.\nLa segunda cosa inusual es su licencia Creative Commons (Reconocimiento-No comercial-Compartir bajo la misma licencia 3.0 Unported), que permite a cualquiera descargar el ebook, leerlo gratuitamente, difundirlo, remezclarlo, etc. No resulta sorprendente para quienes conocemos a Cory Doctorow, que además de haber escrito varias novelas (ha sido nominado en los premios Nébula y ganó un premio Locus) es co-editor del blog Boing Boing (precisamente sobre cultura, tecnología y libertades) y fue alto directivo de la Electronic Frontier Foundation (sobre libertades civiles y derechos digitales).\nLittle Brother (el título es un guiño al Big Brother de 1984) narra las desventuras de Marcus Yallow, un chaval de 17 años, residente en San Francisco y aficionado a Internet, la informática en general y a destripar y cacharrear con sus propios gadgets. Todo empieza con un atentado terrorista en el Bay Bridge de San Francisco. En medio del caos generalizado uno de sus amigos es apuñalado y el grupo debe separarse de la avalancha de gente huyendo. Ésto hace que las autoridades se fijen en ellos, y el descubrimiento posterior de que Marcus y alguno de sus amigos utilizan encriptación en el teléfono provoca actuaciones más duras sobre ellos por parte de la DHS (el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional).\nCuando Marcus es liberado tras varios días de interrogatorios descubre que todo se ha convertido en un estado policial. Como podemos esperar (as seen in Real World®) parte de la ciudadanía cede encantada en muchos aspectos. Gracias a su talento y a tecnología que cualquiera puede tener en su casa, Marcus comienza a montar un sistema de Resistencia, con redes clandestinas anónimas y encriptadas, y muchos jóvenes dispuestos a luchar.\nEl autor aprovecha varias de estas acciones para sacar su lado más didáctico y divulgativo y explicar, a modo de sencilla introducción, algunas de estas técnicas. Nada excesivamente desconocido pero muchos lectores podrán sacarle partida. En muchos casos la técnica es puramente defensiva y busca la simple supervivencia en una ciudad controlada por las autoridades. Como ejemplo el siguiente fragmento:\n[...] Class ended in ten minutes, and that didn't leave me with much time to prepare. The first order of business were those pesky gait-recognition cameras. Like I said, they'd started out as face-recognition cameras, but those had been ruled unconstitutional. As far as I know, no court has yet determined whether these gait-cams are any more legal, but until they do, we're stuck with them.\nLittle Brother cover  \"Gait\" is a fancy word for the way you walk. People are pretty good at spotting gaits -- next time you're on a camping trip, check out the bobbing of the flashlight as a distant friend approaches you. Chances are you can identify him just from the movement of the light, the characteristic way it bobs up and down that tells our monkey brains that this is a person approaching us.\nGait recognition software takes pictures of your motion, tries to isolate you in the pics as a silhouette, and then tries to match the silhouette to a database to see if it knows who you are. It's a biometric identifier, like fingerprints or retina-scans, but it's got a lot more \"collisions\" than either of those. A biometric \"collision\" is when a measurement matches more than one person. Only you have your fingerprint, but you share your gait with plenty other people.\nNot exactly, of course. Your personal, inch-by-inch walk is yours and yours alone. The problem is your inch-by-inch walk changes based on how tired you are, what the floor is made of, whether you pulled your ankle playing basketball, and whether you've changed your shoes lately. So the system kind of fuzzes-out your profile, looking for people who walk kind of like you.\nThere are a lot of people who walk kind of like you. What's more, it's easy not to walk kind of like you -- just take one shoe off. Of course, you'll always walk like you-with-one-shoe-off in that case, so the cameras will eventually figure out that it's still you. Which is why I prefer to inject a little randomness into my attacks on gait-recognition: I put a handful of gravel into each shoe. Cheap and effective, and no two steps are the same. Plus you get a great reflexology foot massage in the process (I kid. Reflexology is about as scientifically useful as gait-recognition).\n[...]  Otro de los detalles remarcables del libro son las introducciones a cada capítulo. En ellas el autor nos descubre sus librerías favoritas de todo el mundo contando alguna de sus anécdotas en ellas. Las pocas que yo también conozco me encantan (Amazon, Barnes \u0026amp; Noble, Borders, Forbidden Planet, Waterstone's), por lo que en más de un caso me entraron ganas de coger el primer vuelo hasta tales maravillas.\nSin ser una maravilla narrativa ni una historia demasiado sorprendente, recomiendo totalmente su lectura. A cualquiera. Resulta especialmente interesante y absorbente en momentos como el actual, con un riesgo latente de terrorismo que provoca todo tipo de acciones y reacciones por parte de los gobiernos, normalmente a costa de la libertad y privacidad de los ciudadanos.\nMás información, remixes, otras reseñas y múltiples formatos de descarga en la web del libro.\n",

Unas cuarenta personas (contraprogramábamos el fútbol y varias manifestaciones en Madrid ese día, así que no nos fue mal en absoluto) salieron de The Clover House con una bonita guía para discutir con defensores del Diseño Inteligente, por cortesía de nuestro ponente Jesús Zamora Bonilla. En esta nueva edición que hoy anunciamos queremos que haya un poco más de discusión, así que nos hemos traído a Carlos Elías, profesor titular de Periodismo Especializado en la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid y autor, entre otros libros, de \"La razón estrangulada. La crisis de la ciencia en la sociedad contemporánea\". El título de su ponencia será \"La razón estrangulada. El auge de la irracionalidad en la cultura mediática actual\". Que alguien invite a Íker Jiménez. Como siempre, la charla dará comienzo a las 19:30, para que nos dé tiempo a tener un debate posterior. La entrada, como siempre, es gratuita, y sólo se pide al menos una consumición para que los amables propietarios del pub nos dejen volver en junio (y después del verano). Se ruega confirmar asistencia en este formulario de Google Docs para que podamos tener una estimacion. Allí nos vemos. PD: precisamente el otro día se publicó una entrevista a Carlos Elías en La Ciencia y sus Demonios. Merece la pena echarle un ojo.  (Vía Escépticos en el Pub) \n",

    "body": " Tras haber jugado hace poco al juego de cartas La Llamada de Cthulhu LCG tuve un repentino mono de leer a Lovecraft.\nPara saciarlo escogí una selección de relatos con algunos de los relatos más populares:\n El Alquimista Dagón Más allá del muro del sueño Polaris El caos reptante Hechos tocantes al difunto Arthur Jermyn y su familia La tumba Celephaïs  Me ha sabido a poco, y quizá retome el autor muy próximamente, cuando termine los libros que tengo en marcha ahora.\nOs dejo con el inicio de Más allá del muro del sueño:\nCon frecuencia me he preguntado si el común de los mortales se habrá parado alguna vez a considerar la enorme importancia de ciertos sueños, así como a pensar acerca del oscuro mundo al que pertenecen. Aunque la mayoría de nuestras visiones nocturnas resultan quizás poco más que débiles y fantásticos reflejos de nuestras experiencias de vigilia — a pesar de Freud y su pueril simbolismo —, existen no obstante algunos sueños cuyo carácter etéreo y no mundano no permite una interpretación ordinaria, y cuyos efectos vagamente excitantes e inquietantes sugieren posibles ojeadas fugaces a una esfera de existencia mental no menos importante que la vida física, aunque separada de ésta por una barrera infranqueable. Mi experiencia no me permite dudar que el hombre, al perder su consciencia terrena, se ve de hecho albergado en otra vida incorpórea, de naturaleza distinta y alejada de la existencia que conocemos, y de la que sólo los recuerdos más leves y difusos se conservan tras el despertar. De estas memorias turbias y fragmentarias es mucho lo que podemos deducir, aun cuando probar bien poco. Podemos suponer que en la vida onírica, la materia y la vida, tal como se conocen tales cosas en la tierra, no resultan necesariamente constantes, y que el tiempo y el espacio no existen tal como lo entienden nuestros cuerpos en vigilia. A veces creo que esta vida menos material es nuestra existencia real, y que nuestra vana estancia sobre el globo terráqueo resulta en sí misma un fenómeno secundario meramente virtual.  ",

    "title": "Análisis del Nike+ para iPod Touch",

    "description": "",
    "body": " DISCLAIMER: Llevo sólo un par de semanas utilizando el aparato, si critico algo equivocadamente no dudaré en rectificarlo si me doy cuenta más adelante o se me hace saber. Del mismo modo, los inconvenientes hallados en el futuro podrán ser reflejados aquí más adelante. El uso y funcionalidades con iPod nano puede ser diferente.\nMotivación Para alguien que corre escuchando música con un iPod nano, Touch o iPhone, añadir el sensor Nike+ puede ser muy ventajoso. Nadie corre por correr, y no hace falta estar preparando una maratón para querer conocer ciertos datos de los entrenamientos. Siempre buscaremos regularidad y/o evolución, ya sea en tiempos o en distancias.\nAdquisición El sensor puede comprarse en muchos sitios, tanto físicos como online. Para iPod Touch o iPhone es suficiente con el sensor que cuesta unos 15-20€ dependiendo del lugar, para iPod nano habrá que adquirir el pack que viene con sensor y adaptador por unos 30 €. El precio puede variar y quizá sea difícil encontrarlo en stock, puede compensar pagar gastos de envío y recibirlo en casa.\nNike vende varias de sus zapatillas con un hueco bajo la suela para colocar el sensor, pero es posible correr utilizando Nike+ con cualquier zapatilla común. En lugar de pagar 100-200 € a la compañía del swoosh y la mano de obra infantil, podemos comprar por menos de 10 € un enganche para sujetar el sensor Nike+ a los cordones de nuestras zapatillas. Hay varios modelos y sistemas, recomiendo aquellos que son fáciles de poner y quitar por si quieres utilizarlo en varias zapatillas.\nConfiguración El iPod Touch (intuyo que también el iPhone) traen de forma automática la aplicación pre-instalada. Una vez activada te deja elegir una serie de cosas:\n PowerSong. La canción que quieres que suene en los momentos de máximo esfuerzo Voz. Permite elegir con o sin voz, y si prefieres voz femenina o masculina. Unidad distancia. Millas o kilómetros. Peso. Tu peso, para los cálculos de calorías consumidas. Sensor enlazado. En principio se permite enlazar más de un sensor, cambiar el sensor enlazado, etc. Mando a distancia enlazado. Para enlazar un mando a distancia de iPod.    Aplicación El Menú inicial de la aplicación nos permite elegir el tipo de entrenamiento que deseamos realizar, o ver el histórico de los entrenamientos realizados:\n Basic / Básico. No marcamos un objetivo, simplemente queremos registrar nuestra carrera. Time / Duración. Queremos correr x minutos. La aplicación nos avisará cuando termine el tiempo. Distance / Distancia. Queremos recorrer x metros Calorie / Calorías. Queremos correr hasta quemar x calorías. Calibration / Calibración. Permite calibrar mejor el sensor para adaptarlo a nuestra zancada. My Workouts / Mis entrenamientos. Acceso a los entrenamientos marcados como favoritos. History / Historial. Vemos el histórico de nuestras carreras    En todas las opciones de entrenamiento nos permitirá seleccionar la música que queremos escuchar durante la carrera y nos aparecerá la pantalla inicial de entrenamiento.\nEn esta pantalla iniciaremos, detendremos temporalmente o finalizaremos el entrenamiento.\nAdemás de los controles, la pantalla nos muestra el tiempo transcurrido, el ritmo que llevamos y la distancia recorrida.\nPodremos pasar a la siguiente canción, a la anterior o incluso cambiar la música que estamos escuchando, todo ello sin necesidad de detener el entrenamiento.\n  Llegado el caso, podemos minimizar la aplicación para que corra en segundo plano y ejecutar el propio reproductor del iPod, otra aplicación, o correr sin música y simplemente escuchar las indicaciones de la aplicación.\nUna vez terminada la carrera, nos aparecerá la pantalla de Resumen, con la distancia total recorrida, el tiempo, el ritmo y la estimación de calorías quemadas. Esta información se guarda en el histórico y posteriormente se enviará a Internet.\n  Página Web En la página web de NikeRunning podemos hacer varias cosas. En resumen:\n Perfil. Podemos editar nuestra información personal, gestionar una lista de amigos y ver su actividad reciente, configurar los formatos y unidades de medida, etc. Inicio. Está página nos muestra un resúmen de nuestros entrenamientos, el último que hemos hecho, y el estado de nuestros retos, objetivos, etc.   Carreras. En esta sección navegamos por el histórico de las carreras, con la posibilidad de editar para cada una de ellas el tiempo que hacía, las características del recorrido, nuestras sensaciones e incluso notas con observaciones personales.   Objetivos. Para que la actividad deportiva resulte más apetecible existen los objetivos y en menor medida los retos. Tú mismo marcas estos objetivos: por frecuencia, distancia, calorías o ritmo. No tiene más utilidad de la que cada uno le quiera dar.   Retos. Los retos no tienen mucha utilidad más allá de la estadística. Los hay de todo tipo, entre países, entre continentes, entre provincias o Comunidades Autónomas,... La idea es picarte y que eso te haga salir más a correr. Uno de los retos más curiosos es el que adjunto en la captura: kilómetros recorridos por año de nacimiento.   Entrenador. Podemos seleccionar varios entrenamientos, en función de nuestra forma física y objetivos. Lamentablemente los entrenamientos no son editables, no puedo definir cuántos días a la semana voy a poder correr, o cuales, y si te saltas un entrenamiento lo has perdido, no existe la opción de aplazar los entrenamientos restantes para adaptarlos a tu ritmo y posibilidades.   Localízalo. Existe la posibilidad de trazar la ruta que seguimos habitualmente para que otros usuarios puedan verla. Situando el ratón encima de cada cartel veremos la ruta exacta que indica.    Opinión personal Todo esto parece bastante completo, pero debo decir que esperaba bastante más. Como siempre, es una pena que Apple y sus iPod sean tan cerrados y no sea posible sacar más partido a la combinación del sensor y el iPod Touch.\nPor un lado, el tema de los objetivos y el entrenamiento está bastante bien, pero nada de todo esto llega al iPod. Es especialmente sangrante con los entrenamientos. Hay días que tocan cosas como \"camina diez minutos, corre dos minutos, camina otros quince.\". El primer error es tener que mirar en Internet qué entrenamiento toca, el segundo error es no poder recibir indicaciones durante la carrera y tener que simular a mano las instrucciones. Ya que la aplicación se sincroniza con Internet, no costaba demasiado que el iPod guardase los datos de los entrenamientos que debemos realizar y fuese capaz de guiar al corredor.\nOtro problema fueron las instrucciones vocales del iPod. Al principio no funcionaban en absoluto, probé de todo, miré en las páginas de ayuda, en los fotos de usuarios, contacté con otros usuarios... y no encontré nada.\nNo tiene sentido que te permita seleccionar si quieres una voz masculina o femenina si luego no hay voz alguna. Las indicaciones orales son básicas para este sistema. Finalmente contacte con el servicio de soporte de Nike Europa y me dijeron los pasos a seguir:\n Gracias por tu e-mail e interés en Nike+. Con respecto a tu consulta, te informo que debes cambiar el idioma de tu ipod touch por ejemplo al ingles y conecta tu ipod al ordenador el itunes te preguntará si quieres instalar las voces en Ingles dile que si, desconecta todo y vuelve a cambiar la voz en tu ipod touch esta vez en español por ejemplo conecta de nuevo al ordenador el ipod y el itunes te preguntará si quieres instalar las voces en español y eso es todo. Si tuviera alguna otra consulta, no dude en contactarnos nuevamente. Atentamente, Maria NIKE + Europa Atención al Cliente  Me reí bastante con el correo, pero funcionó. Ahora recibo las instrucciones orales que tanto echaba en falta. El iPod me avisa cada x minutos, cada x kilómetros, cuando me quedan x minutos para terminar, cuando me quedan x kilómetros. Además, con sólo pulsar el botón de inicio del reproductor (aunque esté bloqueado) me dice el tiempo que llevo en ese momento, la distancia recorrida, el tiempo, ritmo, etc. Perfecto.\nConclusión: Bastante recomendable por precio y opciones para corredores que ya tengan un iPod compatible y lo utilicen mientras corren. Para el resto de interesados, parecen más interesantes otras opciones.\n",

    "title": "The Blind Watchmaker de Richard Dawkins",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Hace unos días terminé The Blind Watchmaker (El relojero ciego en castellano) de Richard Dawkins, uno de los libros que me traje de Oxford, lugar del que Dawkins es ahora una de las figuras más representativas. Las librerías estaban copadas por todas o casi todas las obras de este etólogo, biólogo y divulgador científico, con especial interés hacia el Darwinismo, la evolución en general y el ateísmo.\nRichard Dawkins - The Blind Watchmaker  El relojero ciego, publicada en 1986, es una de las obras más populares del autor. Dawkins explica clara y fervientemente la teoría de la evolución de Darwin, actualizando a finales del siglo XX los detalles de la misma.\nEl título hace referencia a la analogía del relojero de William Paley que argumentaba, más de 50 años antes de la publicación de El Origen de las Especies por parte de Charles Darwin, que la complejidad de los organismos vivos demostraría la existencia de un creador divino a semejanza de la existencia de los relojes, que hacen pensar en un relojero inteligente.\nCon una narrativa cargada de ejemplos y referencias, trata en varias ocasiones de dar réplica a las diferentes teorías que han surgido, desde las más similares (el Lamarkismo, por ejemplo) a las completamente opuestas (el creacionismo). En cada caso se explican las diferencias y por qué el autor cree que son erróneas.\nUna de las partes más interesantes, y por las que más se recuerda y referencia el libro, es en la que explica el potencial de los pequeños cambios evolutivos. Para ello utiliza el programa Weasel (comadreja) y una simulación para ordenador del relojero ciego (de implementación propia).\nEl programa Weasel, perfectamente explicado en la Wikipedia, hace referencia al conocido teorema de los infinitos monos y la máquina de escribir (un mono pulsando teclas al azar sobre un teclado durante un periodo de tiempo infinito casi seguramente podrá escribir las obras completas de Shakespeare). El objetivo del programa es más modesto, y basta con producir la frase Methinks it is like a weasel ('yo creo que se parece a una comadreja'), proveniente de Hamlet. Al final es pura estadística.\nMás curioso y asombroso resulta el simulador, programado en Java por el propio Dawkins, que de manera sencilla y clara demuestra la efectividad de una serie de mutaciones aleatorias seguidas de una selección no aleatoria para producir formas complejas. Veamos como funciona:\nEn cada paso, tenemos el especímen actual y varias posibles mutaciones aleatorias en 15 genes, que marcarán: la forma general, el color, la profundidad de la recursión, el número de segmentaciones, la separación entre las segmentaciones y la forma que tomará (ovalada, lineal, rectangular,...). Seleccionamos un elemento y pasamos a la siguiente generación:\n  En las primeras generaciones los progresos son muy lentos, y los cambios no demasiado bruscos. Llegamos a la décima generación:\n  La trigésima generación:\n  Y ya los cambios empiezan a ser más evidentes:\n  Después de 60 generaciones (no todas con un cambio visible):\n  Y finalmente tras 70 generaciones:\n  Podríamos seguir eternamente y asombrarnos con las posibles figuras que se obtienen. El propio Dawkins muestra varias de ellas, algunas incluso con cierto parecido con especies reales. Podéis verlas en los enlaces y en el libro.\nEn definitiva, una obra totalmente recomendable para los amantes de la divulgación científica en general, o incluso para curiosos sobre el tema, dado su alto nivel didáctico.\nFor reasons that are not entirely clear to me, Darwinism seems more in need of advocacy than similarly established truths in other branches of science. Many of us have no grasp of quantum theory, or Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, but this does not in itself lead us to oppose these theories! Darwinism, unlike 'Einsteinism', seems to be regarded as fair game for critics with any degree of ignorance. I suppose one trouble with Darwinism is that, as Jacques Monod perceptively remarked, everybody thinks he understand it. It is, indeed, a remarkably simple theory, childish so, one would have thought, in comparison with almost all of physics and mathematics. In essence, it amounts simply to the idea that non-random reproduction, where there is hereditary variation, has consequences that are far-reaching if there is time for them to be cumulative. But we have good grounds for believing that this simplicity is deceptive. Never forget that, simple as the theory may seem, nobody thought of it until Darwin and Walace in the mid nineteenth century, nearly 200 years after Newton's Principia, and more than 2,000 years after Erastothenes measured the Earth. How could such a simple idea go so long undiscovered by thinkers of the calibre of Newton, Galileo, Descartes, Leibnitz, Hume and Aristotle? Why did it have to wait for two Victorian naturalists? What was wrong with philosophers and mathematicians that they overlooked it? And how can such a powerful idea go still largely unabsorbed into popular consciousness?\n ",

Since the mid 1970s, global temperatures have been warming at around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. However, weather imposes it's own dramatic ups and downs over the long term trend. We expect to see record cold temperatures even during global warming. Nevertheless over the last decade, daily record high temperatures occurred twice as often as record lows.

La suspensión de derechos fundamentales es y debe seguir siendo competencia exclusiva del poder judicial. Ni un cierre sin sentencia. Este anteproyecto, en contra de lo establecido en el artículo 20.5 de la Constitución, pone en manos de un órgano no judicial -un organismo dependiente del ministerio de Cultura-, la potestad de impedir a los ciudadanos españoles el acceso a cualquier página web. La nueva legislación creará inseguridad jurídica en todo el sector tecnológico español, perjudicando uno de los pocos campos de desarrollo y futuro de nuestra economía, entorpeciendo la creación de empresas, introduciendo trabas a la libre competencia y ralentizando su proyección internacional. La nueva legislación propuesta amenaza a los nuevos creadores y entorpece la creación cultural. Con Internet y los sucesivos avances tecnológicos se ha democratizado extraordinariamente la creación y emisión de contenidos de todo tipo, que ya no provienen prevalentemente de las industrias culturales tradicionales, sino de multitud de fuentes diferentes. Los autores, como todos los trabajadores, tienen derecho a vivir de su trabajo con nuevas ideas creativas, modelos de negocio y actividades asociadas a sus creaciones. Intentar sostener con cambios legislativos a una industria obsoleta que no sabe adaptarse a este nuevo entorno no es ni justo ni realista. Si su modelo de negocio se basaba en el control de las copias de las obras y en Internet no es posible sin vulnerar derechos fundamentales, deberían buscar otro modelo. Consideramos que las industrias culturales necesitan para sobrevivir alternativas modernas, eficaces, creíbles y asequibles y que se adecuen a los nuevos usos sociales, en lugar de limitaciones tan desproporcionadas como ineficaces para el fin que dicen perseguir. Internet debe funcionar de forma libre y sin interferencias políticas auspiciadas por sectores que pretenden perpetuar obsoletos modelos de negocio e imposibilitar que el saber humano siga siendo libre. Exigimos que el Gobierno garantice por ley la neutralidad de la Red, en España ante cualquier presión que pueda producirse, como marco para el desarrollo de una economía sostenible y realista de cara al futuro. Proponemos una verdadera reforma del derecho de propiedad intelectual orientada a su fin: devolver a la sociedad el conocimiento, promover el dominio público y limitar los abusos de las entidades gestoras. En democracia las leyes y sus modificaciones deben aprobarse tras el oportuno debate público y habiendo consultado previamente a todas las partes implicadas. No es de recibo que se realicen cambios legislativos que afectan a derechos fundamentales en una ley no orgánica y que versa sobre otra materia.  ",

    "body": " La gripe que me tiene encerrado en casa me ha permitido ver una de las pelis que tenía pendientes. Entre todas elegí ver Alatriste, de Agustín Díaz Yanes. Me han encantado casi todos los libros de Arturo Pérez-Reverte, y la saga de Alatriste es una gran joya que recomiendo a todo el mundo. Reconozco que la saga empieza muy bien y va cuesta abajo, pero en general cumple y funciona.\nPasemos a hablar de la peli. Me ha gustado... muy poco. Me quedo con cosas buenas, pero en general es una peli muy mala.\nSobre la dirección, el principal fracaso, decir que no tiene ritmo en absoluto. En gran parte provocado por querer condensar tantas cosas en 2 horas de película sin perder fidelidad ni perder detalles ni personajes. Gran error achacable (por lo que conozco) al director, que apostó por rodar una sola película en lugar de varias o incluso una por libro.\nLos libros enganchan, la peli sin embargo no tiene una trama clara. Tiene muchas subtramas de las que no se muestra inicio ni, en muchos casos, desenlace. Escenas en su mayor parte calcadas de los libros, sin nada que conecte unas con otras. Parece un resumen de la película real, un trailer de dos horas, un \"En anteriores capítulos\" (típico de las series americanas).\nLos actores y personajes a destacar. Viggo Mortensen como Alatriste está muy bien. Le falla la voz, no por el acento, sino porque al forzarlo queda totalmente plano durante toda la película. Juan Echanove como Don Francisco de Quevedo está bien, aunque es imperdonable que en toda la película no diga ni una sola vez \"¡No queda sino batirse!\". Eduard Fernández cumple perfectamente, me gustó mucho. Javier Cámara como Conde Duque de Olivares está bien, salvo por la expresión forzadísima constante de la cara. Ariadna Gil bastante bien, aparece demasiado pero eso no es culpa suya.\nVamos con los palos. ¿Qué oscuro razonamiento llevó a poner a Blanca Portillo como Fray Emilio Bocanegra? Eduardo Noriega no transmite nada (as usual). Unax Ugalde y los guinistas convierten a Iñigo de Balboa en un niñato que se rige únicamente por impulsos sexuales. Elena Anaya lo mismito, la Angélica de Alquézar de la película está a años luz del personaje de las novelas. Pierde toda la mala leche, todo el interés.\nLa fotografía es muy buena, aunque podrían haberse complicado un poco más la vida. No es suficiente con oscurecer las escenas. Se abusa de los planos cortos por no complicarse. El vestuario y el maquillaje cumplen, tampoco creo que se les haya ido el presupuesto en esto ya que no salen más que harapos...\nLas escenas de batalla son bastante lamentables, con todo lo que hemos visto ya, sin inventar nada nuevo se pueden hacer mucho mejor las cosas.\nConclusión: Si no veían suficiente material para varias peliculas, cosa criticable, debían haber hecho una sola pero en condiciones. Menos fidelidad y más cinematografía. Si no vas a desarrollar los personajes (casi ni se desarrolla el del Capitán Alatriste) empieza por eliminar varios de ellos: Fuera Malatesta (que gran decepción), fuera Angélica de Alquézar, fuera María de Castro o incluso fuera Quevedo.\nSi has leído las novelas, te interesará la película (es demasiado fiel para mi gusto). Si no has leído las novelas, te resultará algo más indiferente. En cualquier caso, es interesante por la ambientación y por ser actualmente la peli más cara de la historia del cine español.\nUn 5 sobre 10 en FilmAffinity.\n",

Os hago un resumen, también para los nuevos.\nPitcairn es una pequeña colonia británica en mitad del Pacífico donde viven tan sólo 46 personas. En Septiembre de 2004 siete de ellos (incluído el alcalde), más de la mitad de la población adulta masculina, fueron acusados de más de 100 casos de asalto sexual. Las denuncias empezaron a florecer a partir de la visita de una mujer policia Británica a la isla.\nLlegó la sentencia, y condenó a seis de los siete acusados, pero no fueron a prisión dado que de ellos dependía la comunicación de la isla con el exterior, únicamente posible por barco. La isla más cercana con aeropuerto se encuentra a 36 horas de navegación.\nAhora llegan nuevas noticias otra vez desde BoingBoing. El Gobierno Británico va a construir y financiar una prisión en la isla, aunque los funcionarios de la prisión serán de Nueva Zelanda. El juez encargado del caso desestimo el recurso de los presos, que alegaban que la ley británica no había sido promulgada en la isla y que no estaban bajo su jurisdicción.\nEnlaces internos relacionados:\n Isla Pitcairn Más sobre la Isla Pitcairn  (Via BoingBoing)\n",

    "title": "El Mito de Superman",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Hay tres personajes que para mi están muy por encima del resto: Batman, Spider-Man y Superman.\nSon diferentes al resto, quizá son más cercanos al lector, aunque curiosamente son totalmente diferentes entre ellos en algo básico. Batman es un simple humano, Spidey es más que eso y Superman no lo es en absoluto :-D\nÚltimamente están de moda las peliculas de super-héroes. Esperé ansioso las primeras de X-Men (como ahora espero la tercera), a DareDevil, a Hulk y a tantos otros. Disfruté de la primera y la última de Batman (no tanto de las otras). Pero la angustia por el próximo estreno de una nueva entrega de Superman es insuperable.\nHace mucho de las primeras y estupendas películas de Superman, la industria del cine ha cambiado radicalmente. No sólo en efectos, también en conceptos. Bryan Singer, director de la nueva entrega, no es mi favorito, pero desde luego sabe hacer las cosas.\nLlevaba tiempo deseando hablar del tema. De hecho, ultimamente escribo mucho menos de lo que me gustaría. Aprovecho que hoy me he encontrado en Wired un interesantísimo artículo de Neil Gaiman y Adam Rogers (editor de la revista). Lo suscribo punto por punto. Tanto que lo he traducido al castellano para quienes tengan problemas con el inglés. Siguiendo el enlace accedéis al original.\nPerdón si se ha colado alguna falta o frase extraña. He tenido que revisar de arriba a abajo la traducción automática y no ando con mucho tiempo.\nThe Myth of Superman By Neil Gaiman \u0026amp; Adam Rogers Hace aproximadamente una década, Alvin Schwartz, que escribió historietas de Superman en los años 40 y 50, publicó uno de los Libros Raros más importantes de nuestro tiempo. En An Unlikely Prophet, reeditado en libro en rústica esta primavera, Schwartz escribe que Superman es real. Él es un tulpa, una palabra tibetana para un ser traído a la vida por el pensamiento y la voluntad. Schwartz también dice que un kahuna hawaiano le dijo que Superman una vez viajó 2.000 años atrás a tiempo para impedir que el archipiélago fuese destruido por la actividad volcánica. Tal vez pasó, tal vez no, pero esto realmente suena a un trabajo para Superman - todo en un día de trabajo para un tipo que puede exprimir el carbón para sacar diamantes. Schwartz entonces cuenta de su propio encuentro con Superman en un taxi de Nueva York, cuando él aprendió directamente que la capa de Superma es, de hecho, más que mera tela. An Unlikely Prophet brinda una pregunta importante sobre Superman: ¿Qué hace que la gente quiera conocerlo con tanto anhelo? Es difícil imaginarse un libro similar sobre, digamos, Linterna Verde o Capitán América. Superman es diferente porque él realmente no pertenece a los escritores que han creado sus aventuras durante los últimos 68 (y más) años. Él se ha desarrollado en un héroe popular, una fábula, y el público parece que tiene mucho interés en quien es Superman. Schwartz dejó de escribir Superman porque sus jefes le decían que pusiese cosas que él pensaba fuera del personaje. Esto es admirable, pero realmente, las historias específicas que contamos sobre Superman - lo que pasó y lo que él hizo - no importan mucho. Superman supera la trama. Volvemos a contar sus cuentos porque lamentamos que él no esté aquí, de verdad, manteniendonos a salvo. Todos conocen la historia de Superman: llegó en cohete a la Tierra del planeta distante Kripton justo antes de que explotase, criado con cariño por una pareja de Kansas, poseedor de poderes y capacidades mucho más allá de cualquier hombre mortal, defiende la ciudad de Metropolis - y el mundo - del mal. Su origen en el mundo real es más humilde: Jerry Siegel y Joe Shuster, dos niños judíos de Cleveland, lo crearon como un personaje en una historieta de periódico. Pero la tira no se vendió bien, entonces ellos lo reformatearon y lo lanzaron a un editor hambriento de comprar contenido para uno de los primeros cómics. Cuando la historia apareció en la publicación de estreno de la antológica Action Comics, los niños se volvieron locos con ello, como si siempre hubo un agujero con forma de Superman en el mundo y ahora se llenase. Es el clásico caso de éxito americano en un par de niveles. Dos forasteros crean una nueva forma de arte, y Superman - un extraterrestre en tierra extraña - despega. \"Dada la naturaleza de los Estados Unidos, era natural en los años 1930 para nuestro nuevo héroe ser un inmigrante exclusivo\", dice a Bryan Singer, director de la nueva película Superman Returns. \"Soy hijo único, adoptado, y de niño me identifiqué extraordinariamente con aquel aspecto de Superman. La escena donde los Kent deciden criarlo siempre me toca\". Por supuesto, el bebé Clark tiene un destino especial. El puede literalmente ser nuestra salvación, dotado con todos los principios ? el vuelo, la fuerza, la invulnerabilidad ? más los poderes comodín de la supervisión, de la visión calorífica, de la visión de radiografía, y de aliento de superfrío. El solía ser aún más increíble; antes una revisión radical a mediados de los 80, él podría mover planetas y correr más rápido que la velocidad de la luz. La capa era infinitamente elástica y nunca rompió. El tuvo el super-hipnotismo. En la película de 1978, él viajó en el tiempo. No es un superhéroe; es un semidios. Lo que es importante, es cómo Superman utiliza estos poderes. Comparado a la mayoría de los personajes de cómic importantes, él no tiene casi villanos memorables. Piense en Batman, en combate eterno con rarezas nocturnas como el Joker o Spider-Man, luchando con bichos raros megalómanos como Dr. Octopus. Para Superman, hay bastante solo con el amargo y calvo Lex Luthor, siendo reinventado siempre por escritores y artistas en un esfuerzo de hacerlo un enemigo digno. Los verdaderos enemigos de Superman son los desastres como terremotos y huracanes, los aviones a reacción que caen del cielo, o enormes meteoros que aplastarían ciudades. Superman interviene entre la humanidad y un universo caprichoso. La película de Singer no se ha proyectado en su totalidad, así que nadie sabe lo que él añadirá al mito. Los pocos minutos de la película que externos han visto (en un DVD que se destruye después de ser visto) parecen buenos, un sucesor espiritual a las películas de Richard Donner de hace veinticinco años. Los efectos especiales serán impresionantes. Pero el Superman de Singer será menos interesante que su Clark Kent. De todas las relaciones en el corazón del mito ? Superman y Lois Lane, Superman y Jimmy Olsen, Superman y sus padres adoptivos ? el más importante es el suyo con su alter ego. En 1959, Jules Feiffer hizo una tira humorística clásica acerca de esa dinámica. En ella, Superman ?tiró este polluelo del río? y, después de ser brevemente victima de sus preguntas freudianas acerca de su motivo para rescatar a personas todo el tiempo, él lo deja. Se establece y pasa el resto de su vida fingiendo ser humano ? yendo a trabajar, viendo la televisión. En menos que una página, Feiffer captura la guerra interna entre la obligación moral de Superman para hacer el bien y su anhelo para ser un tipo corriente. Otros héroes realmente sólo fingen: Peter Parker juega a ser Hombre Araña; Bruce Wayne juega a ser Batman. Para Superman, el periodista afable Clark Kent es el disfraz ? es a lo que él aspira, lo que él nunca podrá ser. Él es realmente ese héroe, y nunca será uno de nosotros. Pero nosotros lo adoramos por intentarlo. Nosotros lo adoramos por querer protegernos de todo, incluso de su propia trascendencia. El juega a ser el Kent torpe y amante abandonado para que nosotros la gente normal podamos sentirnos, sólo por un momento, super. (Via BoingBoing)\n",

Tras darme un reconstituyente baño caliente, ponerme al día con el correo y ojear todos vuestros blogs, escribo un pequeño post de agradecimiento para que sepáis que llegué bien.\nTras un viernes agotador (salida a las 4 am, 6 horas de coche, 8-9 horas de feria, ducha rápida, y juerga hasta las mil) el sábado nos levantamos medianamente pronto para dar una vuelta por la Ciudad Condal.\nAlguno de mis acompañantes se quedó directamente durmiendo, y los otros se marcharon al hotel a dormir la siesta después de comer por el centro. De esa forma, me encontré a las 15 horas bajo el Arco del Triunfo... tres horas antes de tiempo :-P\nHice unas llamadas y Txapulín pudo acudir una hora antes de lo previsto (gracias de nuevo, te robé tiempo con la familia). Mientras le esperaba me dio tiempo a conocer al dedillo el Parque de la Ciudadela y los alrededores. Tras la ansiada presentación, tomamos un largo café marujeando de todo lo marujeable.\nA la hora señalada acudimos al punto de encuentro, donde ya se encontraban los demás: Elengaer, Uroboros, Jamfris y Dan Solo.\nEsperamos un rato a posibles visitantes sorpresa y empezamos la ruta por tiendas de frikiterías. Increíble cuanta tienda parecida junta en sólo un par de manzanas. Memorable, totalmente digno de ver.\nTras recoger a Estela (esposa de Txapu) fuimos al Born a tomar las esperadas cervezas. Tertulia interesante sobre cine, comics, juegos de ordenador. Uroboros nos confesó ser el campeón invicto de España de La Ira del Dragón (Juego de cartas tipo Magic que sacó Heraclio Fournier). Nos propusimos conseguir de algún modo el juego para ganarle, cosa que no parece fácil.\nTras esto cuatro de nosotros fuimos a cenar a un encantador restaurante recomendado encarecidamente por Elengaer y Uroboros. Esperando a disponer de una mesa, paseamos por toda la zona del Born y el Gótico, descubriéndome entre Dan Solo y Txapu todas las maravillas escondidas al visitante despistado, algunas incluso para los nativos.\nDeliciosa cena en un establecimiento encantador (Restaurante Petra, en la C/ Sombrerers nº13, teléfono 93.319.99.99, junto al Passeig del Born), con una carta fascinante, exquisito trato al cliente, y la espectacular compañía de Txapu, Estela y Dan Solo. Tomen nota.\nBeor, sólo por joder un poco más (ya le mandé una foto del Museo del Chocolate, y del escaparate de un Xocoa), mi postre fue una especie de bizcocho de chocolate con chocolate caliente por encima. Imagina un Brownie si le quitas todos los ingredientes que no sean chocolate XDDD\nEl taxi me llevó al hotel entrada la madrugada. Tuve mi merecido sueño, sólo interrumpido para ver la fantástica carrera de Formula 1, antes de partir de vuelta a Madrid.\nComo olvidé preguntar si a alguien le molestaba que apareciesen las fotos, por ahora no las pondré. Son sólo tres, y aparecerán dentro de unos días si nadie se opone.\nActualización 16/10/2005: Aquí tenéis las fotos a buena calidad ([1] [2] y [3]).\n",

    "body": " Acabo de terminar lo poco que me quedaba de una de las obras más populares de Julio Verne, Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino.\nEl principio me encantó, así como partes del final, pero reconozco que la parte central del libro me aburrió enormemente, con pocas excepciones. Quizá si lo hubiera leído en otro momento con menos sensación de pérdida de tiempo...\nLas primeras dos páginas referentes a las distintas especies animales que veían los protagonistas desde el Nautilus eran correctas, a partir del milésimo párrafo clasificando por completo la flora y fauna marina pierde todo su interés.\nEn algunos casos esos párrafos partían por la mitad las tramas. Vamos a ver, señor Verne, está usted bien documentado, no es necesario demostrarlo cada diez páginas.\nDe cualquier modo, libro recomendable y muy interesante. Magníficos los personajes, tanto el Capitán Nemo, como el oceanógrafo Aronnax o el arponero Ned Land. Sin olvidar al propio Nautilus, que acapara el protagonismo en varias fases del libro.\nOtra vez Verne lanza preguntas al aire, ¿sería posible todo esto en el siglo pasado? ¿lo es ahora? Probablemente sí. Lo que parece igual de probable es que los fondos marinos ya no cuenten con las riquezas que el Capitán Nemo mostró a sus invitados.\nNo he tenido dudas acerca del pasaje de esta novela que debía mostraros.\nVeinte mil leguas de viaje submarino\nJulio Verne [...]Habíamos llegado a una primera meseta donde otras sorpresas me esperaban aún. Allí se dibujaban pintorescas ruinas, que revelaban la mano humana y no sólo la divina. Eran amplios amontonamientos de piedras en donde se distinguían vagas formas de castillos, templos revestidos de un mundo de zoófitos en flores, y a los cuales, en lugar de lianas, las algas y los fucos formaban un espeso manto vegetal. Pero ¿qué era, pues, esa porción del globo hundida por los cataclismos?... ¿Quién había dispuesto estas rocas y estas piedras como dólmenes de los tiempos prehistóricos?... ¿En dónde me hallaba, adónde me había arrastrado la fantasía del capitán Nemo? Hubiera querido interrogarle. Al no poderlo hacer, le paré. Le agarré del brazo. Pero él, moviendo la cabeza y señalándome el último pico de la montaña, pareció decirme «¡Adelante! ¡Adelante todavía! ¡Adelante siempre!» Le seguí en un último impulso y, en pocos minutos, tuvimos escalado el pico, que dominaba en una docena de metros toda aquella masa rocosa. Miré ese lado que acabábamos de flanquear. La montaña no se elevaba sino 26 o 28 metros por encima de la planicie; pero, desde su vertiente opuesta, dominaba desde una altura doble el fondo en declive de esta porción del Atlántico. Mis miradas se extendieron a lo lejos y abrazaron un amplísimo espacio iluminado por una fulguración violenta. En efecto, era un volcán esa montaña. A 15 metros por debajo del pico, en medio de una lluvia de piedras y escorias, un ancho cráter vomitaba torrentes de lava, que se dispersaban en cascadas de fuego en el seno de la masa líquida. Así colocado, este volcán, como una inmensa antorcha, iluminaba la pradera inferior hasta los últimos límites del horizonte. Dije que el cráter submarino arrojaba lava, pero no llamas. A éstas les es preciso el oxígeno del aire, y no sabrían desenvolverse bajo las aguas, pero torrentes de lava, que tienen en ellas el principio de su incandescencia, podían producirse al rojo blanco, luchar victoriosamente contra el elemento líquido y evaporarse a su contacto. Rápidas corrientes arrastraban ese gas en difusión, y los torrentes lávicos se deslizaban hasta la base de la montaña como las deyecciones del Vesubio sobre otra Torre del Greco. En efecto, allí, bajo mis ojos, arruinada, abismada, echada por tierra, aparecía una ciudad destruida, con los tejados hundidos, sus templos caídos, sus arcos dislocados, sus columnas yaciendo por tierra, en la que se notaban aún las sólidas proporciones de una especie de arquitectura toscana; más lejos, algunos restos de un gigantesco acueducto; aquí, la bóveda ensamblada de una acrópolis, con las formas flotantes de un Partenón; allí, vestigios de muelles, como si algún puerto antiguo hubiese acogido en otros tiempos, sobre los bordes de un océano desaparecido, los buques mercantes y los triremes de guerra; más lejos aún, largas filas de murallas derrumbadas, amplias calles desiertas, toda una Pompeya hundida bajo las aguas, que el capitán Nemo resucitaba ante mis ojos. ¿Dónde estaba?... ¿Dónde estaba? Yo quería saberlo a toda costa; yo quería hablar, yo quería arrancar la esfera de cobre que aprisionaba mi cabeza. Pero el capitán Nemo se acercó a mí y me detuvo con un ademán. Luego, recogiendo un trozo de piedra gredosa avanzó hacia una roca de basalto y trazó esta única palabra: ATLÁNTIDA [...] ",

Brutales los videos (son similares, unos con más calidad, otros con sonido, pero lo mismo) que aparecen al final.\nHecho público a través de WikiNews (o WikiNoticias), \"periodismo de primera mano\", una fuente de noticias de contenido libre, tan libre que cualquiera puede escribir, con lo que eso conlleva a veces.\n [...] Several partygoers felt they should have the right to attend a rave where drugs are being used, so long as they don't personally use them. \"While it may be true that some individuals choose to take drugs at said events like this, myself as well as many others choose to go for the music. Just like anything, you have bad apples, but you shouldn't cut down the tree,\" said one attendee. \"Raves are not the only musical gatherings where drugs are used and distributed,\" said another. Other partygoers felt that the use of force in the shutdown was excessive - numerous eyewitness accounts by concertgoers describe people being beaten, tasered, or attacked with dogs. One account from an attendee, identified as \"Colby\", states: \"I saw at least two people being beaten on the ground while barking, snarling dogs are held just a few feet from them. Weapons were being pointed at unarmed, peaceful civilians. A friend of mine was forced at gunpoint to put his hands on his head and turn around, because he asked if he could get his things from the tent.\" [...]  La fiesta se celebraba en el rancho privado de Child's Ranch, en el Spanish Fork Canyon, en Utah. Ojo a estos detalles que aparecen en el comunicado de la web del Gobierno del Condado de Utah:  [...] From several previous experiences with Rave parties of this size, a large amount of drug use and underage consumption of alcohol occur. In addition reports of sexual assaults, overdoses, firearm violations, vehicle burglaries, and numerous individuals drive from the party under the influence of alcohol and or drugs. Utah County Sheriff's Office Detectives interviewed several females that had attended a prior rave party in the Utah county area in the past month that had been sexual assaulted. These females stated that the combination of drugs and alcohol made them fear for their safety due to the groping and sexual assaults that occurred during the Rave party. In the last year alone one near fatal shooting was investigated by Utah County Sheriff's Office at a similar party. [...] It was verified that more than 250 individuals were at the party, in violation or county statutes and by 11:30 pm law enforcement personnel moved in to curtail and disburse the party. During this process at least 60 arrests were made for weapons offenses, DUI, illegal underage consumption of alcohol, possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine, possession of methamphetamine, possession of ecstasy, distribution of ecstasy, resisting arrest, assault on a police officer, and disorderly conduct. A safety sweep was conducted after the crowd was ordered to disburse and numerous narcotic items were located scattered on the ground which included: cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, mushrooms, alcohol and large amounts of drug paraphernalia. A 17 year old female from West Jordan, found by officers, had overdosed on ecstasy. She was treated and released to her parents. [...] Parents need to be aware of the type of illegal activities that occurs at these type of gathering. Sexual assaults, rapes, overdoses, drugs, alcohol abuse, thefts, and firearms violations. The sale of drugs at these parties is so prevalent that at this particular Rave party drugs were offered to a local off duty emergency medical service personnel who were contracted to be there. In addition two security personnel hired by the promoter were arrested for possession of cocaine and ecstasy  (Via BoingBoing)\n",

    "body": " Hace unos días terminé uno de los mayores éxitos de Julio Verne, De la Tierra a la Luna, y a pesar de mi falta de tiempo, no quería dejar de comentarlo.\nPublicada por primera vez el 25 de noviembre de 1864, tiene en este dato su mayor valía. Esta novela es una clara demostración de la capacidad de inventar el futuro que tenía Verne. Escrito muy ordenadamente (quizá demasiado), contiene múltiples ingenuidades, que se perdonan fácilmente por haberse escrito hace casi 150 años.\nSon los orígenes de la Ciencia Ficción, y hay que conocerlos. Ahora pretendo descubrir el Capitán Nemo que creó Verne en Veinte Mil Leguas de Viaje Submarino.\nDe la Tierra a la Luna\nJulio Verne\n[...]  De la Tierra a la Luna   Sin embargo, Barbicane no perdió un solo instante en medio de las ovaciones de que era objeto. Lo primero que hizo fue reunir a sus colegas en el salón de conferencias del Gun-Club, donde después de una concienzuda discusión, se convino en consultar a los astrónomos sobre la parte astronómica de la empresa. Conocida la respuesta, se debían discutir los medios mecánicos, no descuidando ni lo más insignificante para asegurar el buen éxito de tan grande experimento.\nSe redactó, pues, y se dirigió al observatorio de Cambridge, en el estado de Massachusetts, una nota muy precisa que contenía preguntas especiales. La ciudad de Cambridge, en la que se fundó la primera Universidad de los Estados Unidos, es justamente célebre por su observatorio astronómico. Allí se encuentran reunidos sabios del mayor mérito, y allí funciona el poderoso anteojo que permitió a Bond descomponer en estrellas la nebulosas de Andrómeda, y a Clarke descubrir el satélite de Sirio. Aquel establecimiento célebre tenía, por consiguiente, adquiridos muchos títulos honrosos que justificaban la consulta del Gun-Club.\nDos días después, la respuesta, tan impacientemente esperada, llegó a manos del presidente Barbicane.\nEstaba concebida en los siguientes términos:\nEl director del observatorio de Cambridge al presidente del Gun-Club en Baltimore\n\"Cambridge, 7 de octubre\nAl recibir su atenta comunicación del 6 del corriente, dirigida al observatorio de Cambridge en nombre de los miembros del Gun-Club de Baltimore, nuestra junta directiva se ha reunido en el acto y ha resuelto responder lo que sigue:\nLas preguntas que se le dirigen son:\n1ª ¿Es posible enviar un proyectil a la Luna?\n2ª ¿Cuál es la distancia exacta que separa a la Tierra de su satélite?\n3ª ¿Cuál será la duración del viaje del proyectil, dándole una velocidad inicial suficiente y, por consiguiente, en qué momento preciso deberá dispararse para que encuentre a la Luna en un punto determinado?\n4ª ¿En qué momento preciso se presentará la Luna en la posición más favorable para que la alcance el proyectil?\n5ª ¿A qué punto del cielo se deberá dirigir la puntería del cañón destinado a lanzar el proyectil?\n6ª ¿Qué sitio ocupará la Luna en el cielo en el momento de partir el proyectil?\nContestación a la primera pregunta: ¿Es posible enviar un proyectil a la Luna?\nSí, es posible enviar un proyectil a la Luna, siempre que se consiga dar a este proyectil una velocidad inicial de doce mil yardas por segundo. El cálculo demuestra que esta velocidad es suficiente. A medida que se aleja de la Tierra, la acción del peso disminuirá en razón inversa del cuadrado de las distancias, es decir, que para una distancia tres veces mayor esta acción será nueve veces menos fuerte. En consecuencia, el peso de la bala disminuirá rápidamente, y se anulará completamente en el momento de quedar equilibrada la atracción de la Luna con la de la Tierra, es decir, a los 47/52 del recorrido total. En ese momento el proyectil no tendrá peso alguno, y si salva aquel punto, caerá sobre la Luna por el solo efecto de la atracción lunar. La posibilidad teórica del experimento queda, pues, absolutamente demostrada, dependiendo únicamente su éxito de la potencia de la máquina empleada.\nA la segunda pregunta: ¿Cuál es la distancia exacta que separa a la Tierra de su satélite?\nLa Luna no describe alrededor de la Tierra una circunferencia, sino una elipse, de la cual nuestro globo ocupa uno de los focos, y, por consiguiente la Luna se encuentra a veces más cerca y a veces más lejos de la Tierra, o hablando en términos técnicos, a veces en su apogeo y a veces en su perigeo. La diferencia en el espacio entre su mayor y menor distancia es bastante considerable para que se le deba tener en cuenta. La Luna en su apogeo se halla a doscientas cuarenta y siete mil quinientas cincuenta y dos millas (noventa y nueve mil seiscientos cuarenta leguas de cuatro kilómetros), y en su perigeo, a doscientas dieciocho mil ochocientas noventa y cinco millas (ochenta y ocho mil diez leguas), lo que da una diferencia de veintiocho mil seiscientas cincuenta y siete mil millas (once mil seiscientas treinta leguas), que son más de una novena parte del trayecto que el proyectil ha de recorrer. La distancia de perigeo de la Luna, es, pues, la que debe servir de base a los cálculos.\nA la tercera pregunta: ¿Cuál será la duración del viaje del proyectil, dándole una velocidad inicial suficiente y, por consiguiente, en qué momento preciso se deberá disparar para que encuentre a la Luna en un punto determinado?\nSi el proyectil conservase indefinidamente la velocidad inicial de doce mil yardas por segundo no tardaría más que unas nueve horas en llegar a su destino; pero como esta velocidad inicial va disminuyendo progresivamente, resulta por un cálculo riguroso, que el proyectil tardará trescientos mil segundos, o sea ochenta y tres horas y veinte minutos en alcanzar el punto en que se hallan equilibradas las atracciones terrestres y lunares, y desde dicho punto caerá sobre la Luna en cincuenta mil segundos, o sea trece horas, cincuenta y tres minutos y veinte segundos. Convendrá, pues, dispararlo noventa y siete horas, trece minutos y veinte segundos antes de la llegada de la Luna al punto a que se haya dirigido el disparo.\nA la cuarta pregunta: ¿En qué momento preciso se presentará la Luna en la posición más favorable para que la alcance el proyectil?\nDespués de lo que se ha dicho, es evidente que debe escogerse la época en que se halle la Luna en su perigeo, y al mismo tiempo el momento en que pase por el cenit, lo que disminuirá el trayecto en una distancia igual al radio terrestre o sea tres mil novecientas diecinueve millas, de manera que el trayecto definitivo será de doscientas catorce mil novecientas sesenta y seis millas (ochenta y seis mil cuatrocientas diez leguas). Pero si bien la Luna pasa todos los meses por su perigeo, no siempre en aquel momento se encuentra en su cenit. No se presenta en estas dos condiciones sino a muy largos intervalos. Será, pues, preciso aguardar la coincidencia del paso al perigeo y al cenit. Por una feliz circunstancia, el 4 de diciembre del año próximo la Luna ofrecerá estas dos condiciones: a las doce de la noche se hallará en su perigeo, es decir, a la menor distancia de la Tierra, y, al mismo tiempo, pasará por el cenit.\nA la quinta pregunta: ¿A qué punto del cielo se deberá dirigir la puntería del cañón destinado a lanzar el proyectil?\nAdmitidas las observaciones precedentes, el cañón deberá apuntarse al cenit del lugar en que se haga el experimento, de manera que el tiro sea perpendicular al plano del horizonte, y así el proyectil se librará más pronto de los efectos de la atracción terrestre. Pero para que la Luna suba al cenit de un sitio, preciso es que la latitud de este sitio no sea más alta que la declinación del astro, o, en otros términos, que el sitio no se halle comprendido entre los cero y veintiocho grados de latitud norte o sur. En cualquier otro punto, el tiro tendría que ser necesariamente oblicuo, lo que perjudicaría el buen resultado del experimento.\nA la sexta pregunta: ¿Qué sitio ocupará la Luna en el cielo en el momento de partir el proyectil?\nEn el acto de lanzar la bala al espacio, la Luna, que avanza diariamente trece grados, diez minutos y treinta y cinco segundos, deberá encontrarse alejada del punto cenital cuatro veces esta distancia, o sea cincuenta y dos grados, cuarenta y dos minutos y veinte segundos, espacio que corresponde al trayecto que ella recorrerá mientras dure el avance del proyectil. Pero como es preciso tener también en cuenta el desvío que hará sufrir a la bala el movimiento de rotación de la Tierra, y como la bala no llegará a la Luna sino después de haber sufrido una desviación igual a dieciséis radios terrestres, los cuales, contados en la órbita de la Luna, son unos once grados, deberán sumarse estos once grados a los computados para el avance de la Luna del que ya hemos hecho mención, lo que arroja un total de sesenta y cuatro grados. Así, pues, en el momento del tiro, el rayo visual dirigido a la Luna formará con la vertical del sitio del experimento un ángulo de 64°.\nTales son las respuestas que da el observatorio de Cambridge a las preguntas de los miembros del Gun-Club.\nResumiendo:\n1. El cañón deberá colocarse en un país situado entre los cero y veintiocho grados de latitud norte o sur.\n2. Deberá apuntar al cenit del sitio del experimento.\n3. El proyectil deberá estar dotado de una velocidad inicial de doce mil yardas por segundo.\n4. Deberá hacerse el disparo el día primero de diciembre del año próximo a las once menos trece minutos y veinte segundos.\n5. Encontrará a la Luna cuatro días después de su partida, el día cuatro de diciembre, a las doce en punto de la noche en el momento de pasar aquella por el cenit.\nLos miembros del Gun-Club deben, por tanto, emprender sin pérdida de tiempo los trabajos necesarios para la realización de su empresa y hallarse prestos a actuar en el momento señalado, pues, porque si dejan pasar el día cuatro de diciembre, no hallarán la Luna en las mismas condiciones de perigeo y de cenit hasta que hayan transcurrido dieciocho años y once días.\nEl observatorio de Cambridge se pone enteramente a disposición del Gun-Club para todo cuanto concierna a astronomía teórica, y se suma por la presente a las felicitaciones que la América entera le ha enviado.\nPor el observatorio,\nJ. BELFAST\nDirector del observatorio de Cambridge\n[...]  ",

Hace poco tuvo en riesgo la pierna buena por el mismo motivo.\nEl gran George Mikan fue trasladado el pasado sábado de un hospital a un centro de rehabilitación, pero no pudo superar la última crisis y ha fallecido a los 80 años.\nMikan siempre utilizó sus gafas redondas de alambre para jugar. Fue la primera vez que un hombre alto controlaba la zona, y dominaba los aros, lo que ahora conocemos como pívot o center. Taponaba tantos tiros que llevó a la liga a incluir la norma del \"goaltending\", conceder la canasta si un tiro es taponado cuando empieza el descenso en dirección al aro.\nConsiguió cinco títulos de la NBA con los Lakers en los primeros seis años en la historia del equipo. La primera gran dinastía del baloncesto. Es miembro del Salón de la Fama desde 1959. Batiría todos los records en tapones y rebotes, pero en aquella época éstos aún no se contabilizaban. Fue elegido Mejor Jugador de la primera mitad de siglo XX. Jugó los cuatro primeros All Star. Lideró la Liga en anotación tres temporadas. Se retiró con problemas de lesiones en 1956 con un promedio de 23,1 puntos, altísimos para la época.\nFue la primera gran estrella del baloncesto. Como curiosidad, cuando jugaba un partido en Nueva York, las pantallas que anunciaban el partido simplemente decían \"Tonight George Mikan vs Knicks\".\nMikan fue en 1967 comisionado de la desaparecida Asociación Americana de Baloncesto, introduciendo la línea de tres puntos y también el balón tricolor, uno de los símbolos de la NBA.\nAl contrario de las estrellas actuales, durante toda su carrera cobró un salario de mil dólares al año. Cuenta ahora uno de sus hijos que Mikan no conservaba ninguno de sus títulos porque tuvo que venderlos todos.\nSu importancia es fundamental en el baloncesto actual.

Y, por cierto, no me pierdo su concierto de presentación del nuevo disco el próximo 11 de Junio en Aqualung. Avisados estáis.\nOs copio el fragmento referente al asunto de las descargas \"ilegales\".\n -En la actualidad muchos grupos optan por colgar sus trabajos en internet para que la gente se los pueda descargar gratuitamente, ¿que te parece esa opción? -Me parece una formula bastante razonable y, seguramente, si yo estuviera en esa situación también participaría. Preferiría que me piratearan a que no me conociera nadie. Soy realista. Yo ya he entrado en la dinámica profesional, el rollo de internet es legal y cada uno apechugamos con lo que nos toca.

Pero entiendo que ahora todo ha evolucionado y hay una serie de historias contra las que es muy difícil luchar. También entiendo que no está bien que alguien que compra CD´s para grabar sus trabajos se le cobre un canon porque haya gente que piratee. Está claro que están cambiando los formatos. Internet se debería legislar un mínimo, porque yo no puedo decirle a nadie que no se baje música. Estoy convencido de que quien quiere tener un disco se lo compra.

En algunos momentos la moralina está muy rebajada, pero su simple presencia me da cosa.\nComo todos sabréis, el libro narra la historia de un hombre que va saltando de desgracia en desgracia hasta terminar sólo en una isla desierta. Pinta muy mal al principio, pero su ingenio y muchas dosis de suerte le permiten sobrevivir.\nFaltan descripciones de la lógica que lleva en algunos de sus procedimientos, sólo pudiendo medir la dificultad en la cantidad de meses que le llevaba realizarlos, pero te puedes hacer perfectamente a la idea de lo que supone estar allí, completamente sólo deseando que aparezca cualquiera, que incluso puede ser tu perdición.\nMe ha sobrado el final, que creo enlaza con el intento de hacer el libro más largo que luego se tradujo en escribir una segunda parte de la novela. Al fin y al cabo, son sólo unas páginas más, que ya se leen con desahogo.\nEn parte por el insomnio (cuanto más trabajo menos duermo) he leído el libro muy rápido, en unos siete días que más o menos equivalen a haberlo leído en siete sentadas.\nRobinson Crusoe  Robinson Crusoe\nDaniel Defoe\n[...]\nFue poco antes de las grandes lluvias que acabo de mencionar, cuando me deshice de esto, sin advertir nada y sin recordar que había echado nada allí. À1 cabo de un mes o algo así, me percaté de que unos tallos verdes brotaban de la tierra y me imaginé que se trataba de alguna planta que no había visto hasta entonces; mas cuál no sería mi sorpresa y mi asombro cuando, al cabo de un tiempo, vi diez o doce espigas de un perfecto grano verde, del mismo tipo que el europeo, más bien, del inglés.\nResulta imposible describir el asombro y la confusión que sentí en este momento. Hasta entonces, no tenía convicciones religiosas; de hecho, tenía muy pocos conocimientos de religión y pensaba que todo lo que me había sucedido respondía al azar o, como decimos por ahí, a la voluntad de Dios, sin indagar en las intenciones de la Providencia en estas cosas o en su poder para gobernar los asuntos del mundo. Mas cuando vi crecer aquel grano, en un clima que sabía inadecuado para los cereales y, sobre todo, sin saber cómo había llegado hasta allí, me sentí extrañamente sobrecogido y comencé a creer que Dios había hecho que este grano creciera milagrosamente, sin que nadie lo hubiese sembrado, únicamente para mi sustento en ese miserable lugar.\nEsto me llegó al corazón y me hizo llorar y regocijarme porque semejante prodigio de la naturaleza se hubiera obrado en mi beneficio; y más asombroso aún fue ver que cerca de la cebada, a todo lo largo de la roca, brotaban desordenadamente otros tallos, que eran de arroz pues lo reconocí por haberlos visto en las costas de África.\nNo solo pensé que todo esto era obra de la Providencia, que me estaba ayudando, sino que no dudé que encontraría más en otro sitio y recorrí toda la parte de la isla en la que había estado antes, escudriñando todos los rincones y debajo de todas las rocas, en busca de más, pero no pude encontrarlo. Al final, recordé que había sacudido la bolsa de comida para los pollos en ese lugar y el asombro comenzó a disiparse. Debo confesar también que mi piadoso agradecimiento a la Providencia divina disminuyó cuando comprendí que todo aquello no era más que un acontecimiento natural. No obstante, debía estar agradecido por tan extraña e imprevista providencia, como si de un milagro se tratase, pues, en efecto, fue obra de la Providencia que esos diez o doce granos no se hubiesen estropeado (cuando las ratas habían destruido el resto) como si hubiesen caído del cielo. Además, los había tirado precisamente en ese lugar donde, bajo la sombra de una gran roca, pudieron brotar inmediatamente, mientras que si los hubiese tirado en cualquier otro lugar, en esa época del año se habrían quemado o destruido.\nCon mucho cuidado recogí las espigas en la estación adecuada, a finales de junio, conservé todo el grano y decidí cosecharlo otra vez con la esperanza de tener, con el tiempo, suficiente grano para hacer pan. Pero pasaron cuatro años antes de que pudiera comer algún grano y, aun así, escasamente, como relataré más tarde, pues perdí la primera cosecha por no esperar el tiempo adecuado y sembrar antes de la estación seca, de manera que el grano no llegó a crecer, al menos no como lo habría hecho si lo hubiese sembrado en el momento propicio.\nAdemás de la cebada, había unos veinte o treinta tallos de arroz, que conservé con igual cuidado para los mismos fines, es decir, para hacer pan o, más bien, comida ya que encontré la forma de cocinarlo sin hornearlo aunque esto también lo hice más adelante.[...] ",

Si en su momento comenté que Yo, Robot sentaba las bases de la robótica, esta novela nos describe perfectamente el comportamiento y saber hacer de todo buen pirata.\nOs dejo el encuentro entre el joven Jim y John Silver, uno de los bucaneros más conocidos de la literatura universal.\nLa Isla del Tesoro\nRobert Louis Stevenson\n[...]\nCuando acabé de desayunar el caballero me dio una nota dirigida a John Silver, en la taberna El Catalejo, y me dijo que no tendría dificultad en encontrar el lugar: tenía que seguir por el muelle hasta llegar a una pequeña taberna con un gran catalejo de latón a modo de cartel. Eché a andar, emocionado ante la perspectiva de poder ver más barcos y marineros, y me fui abriendo camino entre una gran muchedumbre de gente y carretillas y fardos, pues el puerto estaba en su momento de máxima actividad, hasta que encontré la taberna en cuestión.\nEra un lugar bastante agradable. El cartel estaba recién pintado, las ventanas tenían unas bonitas cortinas rojas y el suelo estaba barrido y cubierto de arena limpia. Se encontraba entre dos calles y tenía sendas puertas que daban a ellas, por lo que la espaciosa sala de la planta baja resultaba muy luminosa a pesar de las nubes de humo de tabaco.\nLos clientes eran en su mayoría marineros y hablaban tan alto que me quedé clavado en la puerta y casi me dio miedo entrar.\nMientras me encontraba allí indeciso, salió un hombre de un cuarto lateral y, en cuanto lo vi, comprendí que aquél era John el Largo. Tenía la pierna izquierda amputada casi a la altura de la cadera y bajo el brazo izquierdo llevaba una muleta que manejaba con asombrosa destreza, saltando de un lado para otro como un pájaro. Era muy alto y fuerte y tenía la cara tan grande como un jamón, aplastada y pálida, pero de expresión inteligente y risueña. La verdad es que parecía que estaba de excelente humor y silbaba mientras iba de un lado para otro entre las mesas, dirigiendo a sus parroquianos predilectos una palabra amable o dándoles una palmadita en el hombro.\nPara seros sincero he de decir que, desde que el caballera Trelawney mencionara por primera vez en su carta a John el Largo, se me había metido en la cabeza la idea de que pudiera ser el dichoso marinero cojo del que estuve tan pendiente en mi querida posada de Benbow. Pero me bastó echarle un vistazo al hombre que tenía delante. Yo había visto al capitán y al Perro Negro y al ciego Pew, y creía que era capaz de reconocer a un bucanero: alguien muy distinto, en mi opinión, de aquel tabernero aseado y cordial.\nAl momento saqué fuerzas de flaqueza, crucé el umbral de la puerta y me dirigí al lugar donde estaba el hombre, apoyado en la muleta, conversando con un parroquiano.\n- ¿El señor Silver, señor? -pregunté enseñando la nota.\n- Soy yo, muchacho -me contestó-. A fe mía que ése es mi nombre. ¿Y tú quién eres?\n[...] ",

La iniciativa es una \"solución\" a las trabas de la Administración estadounidense a otorgar nuevos permisos de trabajo y es, además, mucho más barato que terciarizar a miles de Km de distancia.\nUna compañía informática norteamericana llevará programadores indios por los mares para trabajar como programadores y con sueldos paupérrimos, una posibilidad totalmente legal aunque cruel.\nLa compañía Sea Code decidió tercerizar proyectos en el agua. Así, contratará a trabajadores de la India para emplearlos a bordo del \"crucero\".\nLos 600 empleados que piensa contratar Sea Code viviran en el buque por un periodo máximo de cuatro meses, donde deberán comer, trabajar y dormir mientras programan software para decenas o centenares de empresas estadounidenses.\nFrente a los Ángeles Los cerebros de este proyecto son un ejecutivo informático, Roger Green, y su coequiper, David Cook. Ambos planificaron esta aventura maritime y, aunque suene extraño, en la primera semana del lanzamiento del proyecto, su sitio web quedo casi colapsado por la cantidad de interesados en participar de la experiencia.\nEl crucero anclará justo frente a las costas de Los Angeles, pero a cinco kilómetros, que es el límite marítimo de aguas extraterritoriales. Así, estos empleados no estarán amparados por la ley laboral de Estados Unidos ni solicitar permisos de trabajo ni residencia.\nLa empresa, en tanto, es una compañía de software de San Diego, que con este proyecto apuesta a reducir costos laborales y vender programas y proyectos baratos para sus clientes.\nMás barato que en la India ¿Por qué no instalar sus oficinas en el sudeste asiático en vez de llevar los empleados sobre el agua? Simplemente, por una reducción de costos. Enviar ejecutivos o técnicos desde países del tercer mundo les cuesta mucho tiempo y dinero. Sobre el agua, los empleados van tocando distintos continentes.\nLa otra razón es que en aguas internacionales, los costos laborales se reducen. La firma se hace cargo de los gastos de alojamiento y comida y además, como sucede con muchos tripulantes de barcos de bandera, la legislación laboral siempre beneficia al patrón del buque  ",

Mucho tiempo. A la magnífica obra de Calderón, se une esta vez el genial trabajo de los actores, que no se quedaban en simples recitadores, como suele pasar otras veces.\nEn esta espectacular comedia todos los personajes están relacionados, creando lazos a través de mentiras, burlas y falsas apariencias.\nPrincipalmente narra la historia de una dama, Doña María, pretendida por dos galanes, Don Juan y Don Diego, aunque ella desde el principio declara su amor al primero de ellos. El joven se esconde para evitar ir a luchar a Flandes, pero la criada de Doña María no puede guardar el secreto y se lo cuenta a su amante, criado del otro pretendiente. Este, desesperado, se hace pasar por astrólogo para intentar ganar el amor de la Dama.\nEscenografía minimalista (una silla durante unos minutos es el único decorado) que no me suele gustar, aunque esta vez reconozco que era innecesaria, recayendo el peso de la obra en los versos y la manera de recitarlos.\nEl Astrólogo Fingido\nPedro Calderón de la Barca\nDirector: Gabriel Garbizu\nProductor: Producciones Amara S.L.\nVersión: Miguel del Arco y Gabriel Garbizu\nVestuario y Atrezzo: Almudena Rodríguez y José Luis Patiño\nReparto: Orén Moreno, Patricia Luna, Sergio de Frutos, Nicolás Vega, Lino Ferreira, Carlos Ibarra, Gabriel Moreno, Miriam Montilla, Eduardo Navarro y Javier Román.

Wells en 1898.\nQuizá mi costumbre de fliparme con los sitios abandonados venga de la primera vez que lo leí. En este relato, la Desolación es un personaje más. No cuesta mucho imaginarse el Sur de Inglaterra totalmente arrasado, gracias a las generosas descripciones.\nComo en muchos otros casos, la importancia del libro aumenta exponencialmente si tenemos en cuenta el lejano momento de su publicación.\nMitad advertencia, mitad ficción, para este relato que tomaría gran impulso en 1938 cuando un Orson Welles de 20 años sumió los E.E.U.U. en el pánico con su versión radiofónica.\nTenía que volver a leerlo después de tanto tiempo, ahora que van a estrenar la película de Spielberg y Cruise. De la que tampoco espero mucho, por otra parte.\nLa historia da para mucho más, pero con lo que ofrece es suficiente. Me temo que en la peli meterán mucho subproducto hollywoodiense.\nTotalmente recomendable, imprescindible como tantos otros, con la ventaja de poder leerse en poco tiempo.\nOs dejo con la primera aparición del famoso rayo calórico.\nLa Guerra de los Mundos\nH.G. Wells  La Guerra de los Mundos\nHerbert George Wells\n[...] De pronto, hubo un destello de luz y una cierta cantidad de luminoso humo de color verdoso brotó del hoyo en tres bocanadas distintas, que se elevaron, una tras otra, rectas en el tranquilo aire.\nEste humo (quizá «llama» fuera una palabra más adecuada) resultaba tan brillante que el cielo azul profundo y las brumosas extensiones de pastos comunales hacia Chertsey, salpicadas de negros pinos, parecieron oscurecerse bruscamente a medida que ascendía, y siguieron oscuros tras su dispersión. Al mismo tiempo se escuchó un débil silbido.\nMás allá del hoyo, la pequeña cuña de gente, con la bandera blanca por delante, se detuvo ante ese fenómeno, formando un reducido grupo de pequeñas figuras verticales negras sobre el oscuro terreno. A medida que ascendía el humo verde, sus rostros destellaron con un olor verde pálido que se desvaneció de nuevo cuando aquel desapareció.\nLuego, lentamente, el silbido se convirtió en un zumbido, en un largo y poderoso fragor. Una figura jorobada se alzó del hoyo con penosa lentitud y el fantasma de un rayo de luz pareció parpadear desde ella.\nDe inmediato, brotaron del disperso grupo de hombres destellos de auténticas llamas, un brillante resplandor que saltaba de uno a otro. Fue como si un chorro invisible incidiera sobre ellos y los convirtiera en una llama blanca. Fue como si cada hombre se hubiera convertido repentina y momentáneamente en fuego.\nLuego, a la luz de su propia destrucción, vi como se tambaleaban y caían, y cómo quienes los seguían daban media vuelta y echaban a correr.\nMe detuve con los ojos clavados en la escena, sin darme cuenta todavía de que aquello era la muerte saltando de hombre a hombre en aquella pequeña y lejana multitud. Todo lo que sentí fue que había algo extraño. Un destello de luz casi silencioso y cegador, y un hombre caía de bruces y yacía inmóvil; y, a medida que el invisible rayo calórico pasaba sobre ellos, los pinos estallaban en llamas, y cada seco arbusto se convertía con un sordo sonido en una masa de fuego. Y muy lejos, hacia Knaphill, vi el destello de los árboles, los arbustos y los edificios de madera repentinamente incendiados.\nEsta muerte flamígera, esta invisible e inevitable espada calórica, efectuaba su barrido de forma rápida y firme. La vi acercarse hacia mí por el estallido de las llamas de los arbustos que tocaba. Me encontraba demasiado sorprendido y estupefacto para moverme. Oí el crujir del fuego en los hoyos de arena y el repentino relincho de un caballo que fue alcanzado. Luego fue como si un dedo invisible pero intensamente ardiente fuera atraído por los brezos que había entre los marcianos y yo, y, a lo largo de una línea curva más allá de los hoyos de arena, el oscuro terreno humeó y crujió. Algo cayó con un fuerte ruido, muy lejos hacia la izquierda, allá donde el camino que viene de la estación de Woking se abre paso a los pastos comunales. Después de esto, el siseó y el zumbido cesaron, y el objeto negro con forma de cúpula se perdió de la vista hundiéndose lentamente en el interior del hoyo.\n[...]\n ",

Yo, Robot garantiza todo esto.\nEsta corta novela esta dividida en nueve relatos cortos, conectados entre sí aunque pueden tratarse independientemente. Todos ellos geniales y completamente originales.\nDestaca principalmente por el sentido de cotidianeidad que otorga en 1950 Asimov a un Universo repleto de robots. No sólo parece que sea de lo más corriente, además todo cuadra con la más perfecta lógica.\nLectura imprescindible. Altamente recomendada. Os copio un fragmento orientativo acerca de las Tres Leyes de la Robótica que ideó Asimov, así como su funcionamiento y problemática.\nI, Robot de Isaac Asimov  Yo, Robot\nIsaac Asimov\nKallner frunció el entrecejo y se pasó la mano por la frente.\n- Los robots anteriores nos han creado complicaciones. Nuestros hombres trabajan mucho con radiaciones intensas, ¿comprende? Es peligroso, desde luego, pero se toman las precauciones razonables. No ha habido más que dos accidentes desde que empezamos, y ninguno ha sido fatal. Sin embargo, era imposible explicar esto a un robot ordinario. La Primera Ley declara y se la citaré \"Ningún robot puede dañar a un ser humano, o por inacción, permitir que un ser humano sufra daño\".\n»Esto es elemental, doctora Calvin. Cuando es necesario que uno de nuestros hombres estuviese expuesto por un corto período de tiempo a un campo gamma moderado, que no tuviese efectos psicológicos, el robot más cercano se precipitaba a sacarlo de allí. Si el campo era excesivamente débil, lo conseguía, y el trabajo quedaba interrumpido hasta que todos los robots eran retirados. Si el campo era ligeramente más fuerte, el robot no llegaba nunca al técnico afectado, ya que su cerebro positrónico sucumbía bajo las radiaciones gamma, y nos encontrábamos privados de un robot caro, y difícilmente reemplazable.\n»Tratamos de discutir con ellos. Su punto de vista era que un ser humano en un campo gamma exponía su vida, y que nada importaba que pudiese permanecer en él durante media hora sin peligro. Supongamos, decían, que se olvidaba y permanecía una hora. No podía correr riesgos. Les hacíamos ver que sólo había una remota posibilidad de que perdieran la vida. Pero el instinto de conservación es sólo la Tercera Ley de la Robótica, y la Primera Ley de Seguridad viene primero. Les ordenamos estricta e imperativamente mantenerse fuera del campo gamma a toda costa. Pero la obediencia es sólo la Segunda Ley de la Robótica, y la Primera, la de la seguridad, viene primero. Doctora Calvin, o prescindíamos de los robots, o hacíamos algo con la Primera Ley, y esto fue lo que elegimos.\n- No puedo creer que encontrasen el modo de suprimir la Primera Ley - dijo Susan Calvin.\n- No fue suprimida, sino modificada. Se construyeron cerebros positrónicos que poseían sólo el aspecto positivo de la ley, que dice: \"Ningún robot debe dañar a un ser humano\". Eso es todo. No tienen la obligación de evitar que un robot sufra daño debido a un factor extraño, como los rayos gamma.[...]\n ",

Así pues, Q es una novela histórica, pero también, y ante todo, es una novela de aventuras y espionaje donde el verdadero protagonista es la multitud: herejes, espías, putas, cortesanos, mercenarios, profetas improvisados, siervos...\nUna novela coral en estilo y contenido que en todos los países en los que ha sido traducida ha cosechado un rotundo éxito.\n Por la cercanía de mi cumpleaños y mi felicitación de hace unos días, Tindriel me regaló un de los libros que hace tiempo perseguía. Se trata de Hijos de la Mente, cuarta entrega de la Saga de Ender, de Orson Scott Card.\nSegún parece es muy inferior al resto de la saga, pero habrá que leerlo, me gustaron mucho los dos primeros, aunque en su momento el tercero me cansó bastante, y por eso no compré el cuarto (éste).\nHijos de la Mente\nOrson Scott Card  Hijos de la Mente\nOrson Scott Card\nContraportada: Lusitania es un planeta donde coexisten tres especies inteligentes: los pequeninos, que evolucionaron en el mismo planeta; los humanos, que llegaron como colonizadores; y la Reina Colmena y sus insectores, traídos por el joven Ender años atrás.\nEl planeta ha sido condenado a desaparecer por el Consejo Estelar a causa de la descolada, el virus letal para los humanos e imprescindible para la biología de los pequeninos.\nJane, la inteligencia artificial aliada de Ender, logra salvar momentáneamente Lusitania al hacer posible que Ender cree dos nuevos seres, dos aiúas, réplicas de su hermano Peter el Hegemón y de su hermana Valentine. Ellos dos se unen a Ender en la difícil lucha por salvar Lusitania.\nHijos de la Mente es el digno colofón de la serie más popular de la ciencia ficción moderna.\n ",

Todo lo que me falta quizá lo encontremos en la segunda o en la tercera parte. Pero faltan cosas, muchas, para que pueda decir de este chico lo que otros ya han dicho.\nLa historia es buena, el libro no lo es tanto. Hace tiempo que las novelas de fantasía dejaron de ser Tipo Conan (como yo lo llamo), con un héroe venciendo los enemigos que salen a su paso, sin que sepamos muy bien los objetivos de unos y otros.\nAl final del libro lees tantos agradecimientos a sus padres y editores que le han corregido tanto, y me parece que no lo hicieron suficiente.\nSoy a duras penas capaz de imaginarme la mayoría de las cosas. Faltan descripciones, imprescindibles en una obra de fantasía. De los omnipresentes úrgalos poco se sabe, aparte de ser grandes, feos y peligrosos. Ocurre igual con casi todo.\nAl principio Eragon me recordaba un poco a Ender, pero lo que Scott Card resolvió fenomenalmente, a Paolini le sale mucho más falso según avanza el libro.\nY por último, la existencia de tantos nombres robados de Tolkien, más que parecerme un buen homenaje, me hacen ver una enorme falta de imaginación por parte del autor.\nEste refrito de otras historias, interesante para una lectura poco exigente, podría dar mucho más de sí. Esperemos que mejore en Eldest (segundo libro, aún sin publicar) o en libros posteriores. Al fin y al cabo, hablamos de un autor muy joven.\nEragon de Christopher Paolini  Eragon\nChristopher Paolini\n[...]Una súbita explosión quebrantó la noche.\nEl rebaño echó a correr. Eragon se abalanzó sobre la hierba mientras un viento feroz le azotaba las mejillas. De pronto, se detuvo y disparó una flecha sobre la cierva que se alejaba saltando. Erró por muy poco, pero la flecha silbó en la oscuridad. El muchacho soltó una maldición, giró en redondo y colocó otra flecha instintivamente.\nA su espalda, donde había estado la manada de ciervos, humeaba un gran círculo de hierba y de árboles. Muchos pinos permanecían en pie, pero desprovistos de sus hojas, y la hierba que rodeaba el exterior del círculo calcinado estaba aplastada, al tiempo que una voluta de humo se elevaba por el aire transportando el olor a quemado. En el centro de la zona devastada yacía una gema de color azul brillante sobre la cual se arremolinaban frágiles zarcillos impulsados por la neblina que serpenteaba por el chamuscado terreno.\nEragon se quedó al acecho del peligro durante varios minutos, pero lo único que se movía era la niebla. Aflojó la cuerda del arco con cuidado y avanzó. La luz de la luna proyectó una pálida sombra del cuerpo del muchacho cuando éste se detuvo delante de la gema. Eragon la empujó con una flecha y se echó atrás. Como no sucedió nada, la cogió con cautela.\nLa naturaleza jamás había pulido una piedra preciosa tan perfecta como ésa: la superficie era de color azul oscuro impecable, salvo por las finas nervaduras blancas que la recorrían como una telaraña. Al tocarla con los dedos, Eragon notó que la gema estaba fría y que era completamente lisa, igual que la seda. Tenía una forma oval de unos treinta centímetros de longitud y debía de pesar algunos kilos, aunque era más liviana de lo que parecía.\n[...]\n ",

En la sucursal de Móstoles he entrado alguna vez en esos años, pero sólo para comprar entradas para algún concierto.\nEl gerente del establecimiento culpa del cierre a su nula rentabilidad, a la piratería, a Internet y al desprestigio del soporte.\nLos 46 trabajadores que se quedarán en la calle lo achacan a la venta del local al grupo Inditex (Zara). Más de mil quinientos metros cuadrados en Gran Vía se pagan muy bien. No tendrán problema en encontrar un comprador generoso.\nLa gente insiste en no culpar a la piratería y a las redes P2P, pero es evidente su influencia. A mi me encanta la música, la necesito, y ahora la tengo sin pagar por ella.\n ¿Podría haber sobrevivido Madrid Rock con esa menor rentabilidad? Si, claro, pero recordemos que es un negocio, una empresa con ánimo de lucro, no es una ONG.\nDentro de poco, para comprar música sólo nos quedará la FNAC y los grandes centros comerciales. La música 'enlatada' ya no vende. Las discográficas pueden cambiar el modelo de negocio, los artistas pueden centrarse en los directos, pero ¿qué puede hacer una tienda de venta de discos? Rezar para que los artistas y las discográficas bajen su margen y puedan sacar más con cada unidad vendida.\nSupongo que seguirán existiendo todas esas pequeñas tiendas que arropaban a Madrid Rock en los aledaños de la Gran Vía, y que sobreviven (al menos lo hacían antes) a base de vender material de segunda mano o en formatos ya olvidados para regalos, caprichos, o deseos coleccionistas.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Es una gran noticia que se produzca movimiento tras conocer que la productora ha cancelado la quinta temporada de Star Trek: Enterprise.\nLa gente se está organizando, uniendo sus fuerzas. Se han creado bastantes páginas para reivindicar la permanencia de la serie y hace poco han reunido fondos para publicar un anuncio el día 21 de Febrero a toda página y bien posicionado en la edición impresa de Los Angeles Times, gracias en parte a un fan de la serie que trabaja en el periódico.\nEs muy difícil asumir el fin de una serie que se lleva emitiendo de forma continua 39 años, durante cinco décadas, que ha generado cientos de episodios, algunas películas, y el mayor y más numeroso grupo de fans del mundo.\nDescubro a través de Slashdot un comentario del propio J. Michael Straczynski (creador de Babylon 5 y Jeremiah) acerca de su voluntad de relanzar la saga de Star Trek.\n [...] Bryce Zabel (recently the head of the Television Academy and creator/executive producer of Dark Skies) and I share one thing in common. We are both long-time Trek fans, from the earliest days, who felt that the later iterations were not up to the standards set by the original series. (I'm exempting TNG because that one worked nicely, and was in many ways the truest to the original series because Gene was still around to shepherd its creation and execution.) J. Michael Straczynski  Over time, Trek was treated like a porsche that's kept in the garage all the time, for fear of scratching the finish. The stories were, for the most part, safe, more about technology than what William Faulkner described as \"the human heart in conflict with itself.\" Yes, there were always exceptions, but in general that trend became more and more apparent with the passage of years. Which was why so often I came down on the later stories, which I did openly, because I didn't feel they lined up with what Trek was created to be. I don't apologize for it, because that was what I felt as a fan of Trek. That's why I had Majel appear on B5, to send a message: that I believe in what Gene created. Because left to its own devices, allowed to go as far as it could, telling the same kind of challenging stories Trek was always known for, it could blow the doors off science fiction television. Think of it for a moment, a series with a forty year solid name, guaranteed markets...can you think of a better time when you take chances and can tell daring, imaginative, challenging stories? Why play it safe? When Enterprise went down, those involved shrugged and wrote it off to \"franchise fatigue,\" their phrase, not mine. I don't believe that for a second. Neither does Bryce. There's a tremendous hunger for Trek out there. It just has to be Trek done *right*. Last year, Bryce and I sat down and, on our own, out of a sheer love of Trek as it was and should be, wrote a series bible/treatment for a return to the roots of Trek. To re-boot the Trek universe. Understand: writer/producers in TV just don't do that sort of thing on their own, everybody always insists on doing it for vast sums of oney. We did it entirely on our own, setting aside other, paying deadlines out of our passion for the series. We set out a full five-year arc. But when it came time to bring it to Paramount, despite my track record and Bryce's enormous and skillful record as a writer/producer, the effort stalled out because of \"political considerations,\" which was explained to us as not wishing to offend the powers that be. So on behalf of myself and Bryce, I'm taking the unusual step of going right to the source...right to you guys, fueled in part by a number of recent articles and polls, including one at www.scifi.com/scifiwire in which nearly 18,000 fans voted their preference for a new Trek series, and 48% of that figure called for a jms take on Trek (The other choices polled at about 18% or thereabouts). See, if somebody doesn't like a story, doesn't want to buy it, that's all well and good, that's terrific, that's the way it's supposed to be. But when \"political considerations\" are the basis...that just doesn't parse. So here's the deal, folks. If you want to see a new Trek series that's true to Gene's original creation, helmed by myself and Bryce, with challenging stories, contemporary themes, solid extrapolation, and the infusion of some of our best and brightest SF prose writers, then you need to let the folks at Paramount know that. If the 48% of the 18,000 folks who voted at scifi.com sent those sentiments to Paramount...there'd be a new series in the works tomorrow. I don't need the work, I have plenty of stuff on my plate through 2007 in TV, film and comics, so that's not an issue. But I'd set it all aside for one shot at doing Trek right, and I know Bryce feels the same. If you want this to happen...it's up to the Trek and B5 fans to make it so. The rest I leave to the quiet turning of your considered conscience. J. Michael Straczynski  Comparto totalmente su opinión, desde La Nueva Generación, ya nada ha sido lo mismo en el Universo Star Trek. La verdadera fuerza de la serie original, los guiones y los personajes, ya no me enganchan.\nMe ha encantado especialmente una de sus apuestas: Correr riesgos. En sus origenes Star Trek tuvo éxito por mostrar cosas distintas, por llegar más allá. Precisamente por la base sólida que tiene ahora, es el momento de volver a ser verdaderamente originales.\nMe gustó el trabajo de JMS en Babylon 5, y conoce perfectamente el universo trekkie. Puede ser el único que relance Star Trek con éxito. ¿Qué pensáis vosotros? ¿Confiará la Paramount en JMS? ¿Haría bien en hacerlo?\n",

Alonso de Santos): La historia del emperador Claudio es, de alguna manera, un espejo de la historia de Occidente, desde Roma a nuestros días: terrible, llena de crueldad, muerte, sufrimiento, sangre, locura, traición, injusticia, egoísmo, maldades, tiranías... Este peculiar personaje nos permite transitar entre varias épocas, a través de los pasillos de la memoria y de la historia, y nos hace reflexionar sobre algunos de los elementos de la conducta humana dentro de la organización social en que vivimos, heredera de aquella que Claudio vivió. En ese mundo terrible Claudio se hace - y nos hace- algunas preguntas aún no resueltas, que son los grandes debates del hombre sobre la tierra: si es posible que algún día reinen entre nosotros la piedad, el amor, la bondad, la verdad y la justicia.\n Me encantó Héctor Alterio, como en muchas de sus películas (no todas). Cambiaba de registro perfectamente cuando tenía que ser el Claudio cojo y tartamudo, o cuando se trataba del Claudio muerto hablando de su vida. La escenografía está muy cuidada, incluyendo imágenes proyectadas en el fondo, a veces incluso primeros planos de Claudio en momentos de clímax.\nEl resto del reparto cumple perfectamente complementando este monólogo con acompañamiento, quizá podría destacar a Carlos Martínez-Abarca y a Encarna Paso. \n",

No demasiado original hoy en día, pero divertido.\nLa escena se basaba en un espacio libre, ocupado sólo con un baúl, un tronco y una caja de música, y una decoración bastante austera, con siete telas colgando inmóviles que hacen la función de árboles, montañas, edificios, etc. Son los actores los que crean las imágenes, el ritmo y la musicalidad.\nMe gustaron especialmente dos detalles: la interacción con la caja de música, que se abría y cerraba para dar paso a las canciones, y la recreación del mar agitando unas telas azules en primer plano del escenario.\nMe reí mucho con los peluches que aparecían durante toda la obra, especialmente con un chimpancé que participó en un par de conversaciones.\nNoche de Reyes\nWilliam Shakespeare\nDirección: Denis Rafter\nProducción: Gesteatral, S.L.\nReparto: Balbino Lacosta, Gladys Balaguer Mendoza, Israel Ruiz, Patricia Ortega Cano, Manuela Paso, Pilar Gómez Lozano, Jesús Fuente, Ángel García Suárez, Rafael Ramos, César Diéguez.\n El buen gustó de boca que me dejó, se me paso en parte al salir del teatro.

Lo que confirma que de todo lo que me habían dicho, sólo una cosa es cierta: se lee muy rápido.\nAyuda que los capítulos sean de hasta dos hojas, ayuda que la trama salte de un lugar a otro, y supongo que ayuda el propio argumento.\nMe ha parecido bastante flojo. Casi diría que me gustó más El Último Catón de Matilde Asensi. Lo que se supone que es su fuerte, los enigmas, no me han dicho nada. Algunos son para niños pequeños. Casi me meo de risa con aquel de los caracteres indescifrables. No diré más para no desvelar nada.\nLos argumentos históricos se caen por su propio peso, pero no es importante. Es una novela, y puede argumentarse como quiera el autor. Otra cosa es que la gente crea lo que dice, claro.\nPara aquellos especialmente crédulos, les dedico esta página, una de las miles que han surgido. El Secreto de El Código Da Vinci. Si dudas en alguna respuesta, marca la más 'católicamente correcta'.\nEl final no me ha disgustado tanto como a otros. No está mal, pero es bastante previsible. El libro se deja leer, pero en 570 páginas suelo encontrar mejores cosas.\nEl Código Da Vinci\nDan Brown\n[...]\"Una hora\", se dijo a sí mismo, agradecido de que el Maestrio le hubiera concedido tiempo para hacer penitencia antes de entrar en la casa de Dios. \"Debo purgar mi alma de los pecados de hoy\". Las ofensas contra el Señor que había cometido ese día tenían un propósito sagrado. Hacía siglos que se perpetraban actos de guerra contra los enemigos de Dios. Su perdón estaba asegurado.\nPero Silas sabía que la absolución exigía sacrificio.\nCerró las persianas, se desnudó y se arrodilló en medio del cuarto. Bajó la vista y examinó el cilicio que le apretaba el muslo. Todos los seguidores verdaderos del Camino llevaban esa correa de piel salpicada de púas metálicas que se clavaban en la carne como un recordatorio perpetuo del sufrimiento de Cristo. Además, el dolor que causaba servía también para acallar los deseos de la carne.\nAunque ya hacía más de dos horas que Silas llevaba puesto el cilicio, que era el tiempo mínimo exigido, sabía que aquel no era un día cualquiera. Agarró la hebilla y se lo apretó un poco más, sintiendo que las púas se le hundían en la carne. Expulsó aire lentamente, saboreando aquel ritual de limpieza que le ofrecía el dolor.\n\"El dolor es bueno\", susurró Silas, repitiendo el mantra sagrado del padre José María Escrivá, el Maestro de todos los Maestros. Aunque había muerto en 1975, su saber le había sobrevivido, y sus palabras aún las pronunciaban entre susurros miles de siervos devotos en todo el mundo cuando se arrodillaban y se entregaban a la práctica sagrada conocida como 'mortificación corporal'.\nAhora Silas centró su atención en la cuerda de gruesos extremos anudados que tenía en el suelo, junto a él. \"La Disciplina\". Los nudos estaban recubiertos de sangre reseca. Impaciente por recibir los efectos purificadores de su propia agonía, Silas dijo una breve oración y acto seguido, agarrando un extremo de la cuerda, cerró los ojos y se azotó con ella por encima del hombro, notando que los nudos le golpeaban la espalda. Siguió azotándose una y otra vez.\nCastigo corpus meum.\nAl cabo de un rato, empezó a sangrar.\n[...]\n Ahora me pondré con Eragón, de Chritopher Paolini.

El objetivo de Folding@Home consiste en comprender el plegamiento y agregación de las proteínas, y las enfermedades relacionadas.\nTiene además una ventaja. No sólo se puede ejecutar como salvapantallas, puede estar activo constantemente, aprovechando el porcentaje de CPU que tengamos libre. Yo lo tengo puesto en todo momento y no lo noto.\nEs muy interesante. Nos permite conocer más datos acerca de la proteína que estamos plegando, así como de los avances que se han logrado hasta ahora. En la página de resultados podemos incluso ver vídeos del proceso.\n ¿Qué son las proteínas y por qué se \"pliegan\"? Las proteínas son los motores de la Biología, sus \"nanomáquinas\". Para poder desempeñar sus funciones bioquímicas primero se deben auto ensamblar, o \"plegarse\" de manera increíble. El proceso de plegamiento de las proteínas, que resulta crítico y fundamental virtualmente para toda la Biología, continúa siendo un misterio.\nNo sorprende, por tanto, que cuando las proteínas no se pliegan correctamente (es decir, cuando se \"mal pliegan\"), puedan producirse consecuencias graves, que incluyen a enfermedades ampliamente conocidas, tales como las enfermedades de Alzheimer, de la vaca loca ( Encefalopatía Espongiforme Bovina), de Creutzfeldt-Jacob, la Esclerosis Lateral Amiotrófica, y el mal de Parkinson.\n¿Qué es Folding@Home? Folding@Home es un proyecto de computación distribuida, que estudia el plegamiento proteico normal y anormal, la agregación proteica y las enfermedades relacionadas. Usamos métodos de cómputo de avanzada y computación distribuida a gran escala, para simular escalas de tiempo miles a millones de veces mayores que las previamente obtenidas. Esto nos ha permitido simular el plegado proteico por primera vez, y ahora dirigir nuestra investigación al estudio de las enfermedades relacionadas.\n¿Como puede Ud. colaborar? Ud. Puede colaborar en nuestro proyecto descargando y empleando nuestro programa cliente.

Hagamos que crezca.\nLa primera Unidad de Trabajo (Work Unit) tarda bastante. Ignoro el motivo, pero el resto avanzan mucho más rápido. Tened paciencia.

    "body": " Interesante artículo de Javier Armentia, publicado en El Correo, acerca del alcohol y todas sus consecuencias, especialmente una: la resaca.\n Evidentemente lo más notable del consumo de alcohol es cómo afecta a la conducta. Los niveles bajos producen euforia y excitación. Mayor concentración en sangre produce confusión y pérdida de habilidades motoras, visión, concentración. Los efectos extremos llegan a fases en las que no se responde a los estímulos ni se puede mover, aunque se producen vómitos fácilmente por la intoxicación. El coma, e incluso la parada cardiorrespiratoria, son los resultados extremos. Esto se debe al efecto del alcohol en una serie de neurotransmisores cerebrales: el etanol interfiere en los receptores neuronales, afectando su funcionamiento y coordinación. Por ejemplo, dosis bajas disminuyen la acción de los centros inhibitorios de la conducta en el corteza cerebral, lo que produce esa mayor locuacidad, autoestima y desparpajo. Pero también disminuye la capacidad de procesamiento sensorial, y hasta la capacidad de pensar claramente. Los cambios en las emociones se deben a la acción sobre el sistema límbico, y los trastornos psicomotores se dan por la afección del cerebelo. Aparte de ello, lo cierto es que el alcohol afecta en diverso grado a casi todos los sistemas de control del organismo. Y siempre afectando negativamente a su rendimiento habitual.\n ",

Falconer publicado en 1987) hypotetizó la posibilidad de un reloj de sol digital. Inspirados por esto, tres inventores, Hans Scharstein, Daniel Scharstein, y Werner Krotz-Vogel, decidieron hacer realidad el ficticio reloj. El primer prototipo fue construido en Alemania en el verano de 1994, y la invención fue patentizada en Alemania y en los Estados Unidos. Los elegantes diseños de dos tamaños de relojes de sol digitales fueron desarrollados por el ingeniero y artista Felix Scharstein, quien se unió al equipo en 1995. El primer reloj de sol digital exhibido en un lugar público fue construido en un parque de relojes de sol en Genk, Bélgica, en 1998, por ser uno de doce finalistas en una competencia de relojes de sol. Otro reloj es parte de una colección permanente de relojes de sol en él más importante museo de ciencias de Alemania el \"Deutsches Museum\" en Munich. El tercer y más reciente reloj de sol digital se construyó en el techo del Kölnisches Stadtmuseum en Cologne, Alemania. El reloj de sol digital fue también semifinalista en el concurso de Hammacher Schlemmer \" Search for Invention\" '97.  \n",

La mayor parte del coste de un vuelo espacial es relativa al despegue y al aterrizaje. Iniciar un vuelo desde una órbita es sencillo y barato, y aparcar una nave no digamos.

    "body": " Anoche estuve viendo por primera vez una Ópera en directo, la famosa obra de Giuseppe Verdi, Rigoletto, representada por Iberópera con la Orquesta Lírica de Madrid, bajo la dirección de Sergio Kulhmann. Fue una noche de sensaciones encontradas, pero me dejó buen sabor de boca.\nUno de los primeros lamentos fue por las localidades. No quedaban en otro sitio más que en el gallinero, en la zona 'Taburetes Paraiso'. Yo he ido mucho al gallinero del Teatro Español, y desde allí se sigue muy bien la escena. En este caso Paraiso era el nombre del gallinero (esto ya lo sabíamos), y taburete no era en absoluto metafórico, era una fila de taburetes al fondo del gallinero. Gran parte de la obra la pasé de pie, única manera de ver a la orquesta.\nPero sin duda lo peor de todo fueron los subtítulos. La mayor parte del tiempo no iban bien sincronizados, y desluce muchísimo la labor de los actores, que realmente no tienen nada que ver con ello, pero lo pagan. La gente no paraba de comentarlo, mirarse unos a otros, quejarse en silencio, hasta que llegamos a una situación lamentable, como no podía ser de otra manera. El Duque hablando con la hermana de Sparafucile, ella le comentaba como podía estar con una chica tan fea, pero por la locura de los subtítulos, a ese subtítulo le tocó aparecer minutos más tarde, en pleno lamento del Duque. Imaginad uno de los momentos más dramáticos de la obra, con el Duque dejándose los escasos pulmones que le quedaban, y aparece en la pantalla \"Soy fea\". Carcajadas generalizadas que no le sentarían muy bien al actor. Se enteraría después y se cagaría en la familia del tipo que iba pasando los subtítulos.\nEl montaje era horroroso, esperaba una decoración y vestidos de la época, y me encontré con que todo la escenografía se basaba en dos andamios tal cual, y la ropa era de lo más normal. Los cortesanos todos con pantalón y camisa negros, Rigoletto con una muleta y una gabardina para ser diferenciado, el Duque con pantalón y camisa de otro color, muy pobre. Se puede decir que esto es accesorio, que sólo importan los actores y la orquesta, pero no es así. Una cosa es trabajar con bajo presupuesto o buscar la simplicidad, y otra es no currarse para nada el montaje.\nPero me dejó buen sabor de boca. Escuchar esas canciones que tantas veces hemos oído, que todos conocemos, algunas incluso que todos hemos cantado en la ducha, convierte esta obra en algo muy especial.\nEsta obra se estrenó un 11 de Marzo de 1851 en La Fenice de Venecia, tras unos pequeños cambios en nombres y lugares tras tener problemas con la censura, el principal de ellos, cambiar a Francisco I de Francia por el Duque de Mantua.\nLa acción gira en torno al Duque de Mantua y su decadente corte. Rigoletto, bufón de la corte, se burla del Conde Monterone y éste le maldice, cayendo la maldición sobre la hija de Rigoletto, Gilda, que es raptada por la gente del Duque. La pobre Gilda termina pensando que el Duque la ama de verdad, cuando sólo era para él un pasatiempo. Rigoletto planea su vendetta, pero las cosas no salen cómo a él le gustaría.\nLa Donna è Mobile\nGiuseppe Verdi\nRigoletto  La donna è mobile (la mujer es voluble)\nqual piuma al vento, (cual pluma al viento)\nmuta d' accento (cambia de idea)\ne di pensier.

Uno para completar una colección, y otro porque ardo en deseos de leer.\nEl Caballero del Jubón Amarillo, de Arturo Pérez-Reverte es el que me faltaba de la serie de Las Aventuras del Capitán Alatriste. Los libros anteriores no me han gustado demasiado, alguno me dejó bastante indiferente, pero en mi insaciable, enloquecido y enfermizo afán bibliófilo no he podido evitar comprarlo para completar la saga.\nNo sabéis lo bien que me habrían venido esos euros para otras cosas, pero no sabéis lo contento que estoy por gastarmelos en libros.\nEl Caballero del Jubón Amarillo\nArturo Pérez-Reverte\nCurtido a fuego tanto en la guerra como en las pasiones, resultaba difícil pensar que por culpa de una hembra el capitán Diego Alatriste expusiera su cuello al filo de la navaja. El antiguo soldado de los Tercios de Flandes tampoco podía intuir el peligro que le acechaba cuando vislumbró en los negros ojos de la actriz María de Castro la promesa de un juego de humedades. Pero bien valía una noche en sus brazos el infierno que estaba por venir, ya que como el mismísimo Francisco de Quevedo le había sentenciado, aquélla era una mujer de a mil ducados el tropezón. Y desde un corral de teatro madrileño, su suerte, junto a la de Íñigo Balboa, había sido echada. Un lance del destino que le condenaba a resolver, a capa y espada, los tambaleantes derroteros de un rey enredado en amores tramposos. En un imperio donde las letras eran de oro, pero donde el Sol comenzaba ya a ocultarse.\n El otro es La Sombra del Viento, de Carlos Ruiz Zafón. Un autor que ha vendido su libro como churros especialmente en el extranjero. Algo tremendamente difícil para un autor (en su momento) desconocido y aún poco valorado. Debe ser duro ser un idolo en Alemania, y no ser reconocido como te mereces en tu propio pais. Será aquello del profeta en su tierra. Es el próximo que leeré cuando acabe con uno de los que tengo ahora. Le tengo enormes ganas.\nLa Sombra del Viento\nCarlos Ruiz Zafón\nEn 1945, Daniel, un niño de diez años, camina de la mano de su padre, el librero Sempere, para visitar el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados, un rincón secreto perdido entre los recovecos sombríos de la Barcelona vieja. En el laberinto de estantes cargados de libros de toda índole y género se agazapa el misterio de lo inconcluso, obras y autores víctimas de la frágil y huidiza memoria, pasto del fracaso. Hay una regla no escrita según la cual en la primera visita, el recién llegado debe escoger un libro para rescatarlo y protegerlo de la desmemoria. Daniel escoge un volumen que lleva por título La Sombra del Viento, firmado por un autor desconocido, un tal Julián Carax.\nSólo algunos libros son capaces de producir esa fascinación inexplicable que se apodera por siempre de una parte de nuestra viuda, una comunión febril e intransferible entre autor y lector. Durante ocho años Daniel llevará a cabo una incansable búsqueda de Julián Carax, escritor de vida evanescente, desaparecido el triste verano del 36. La sombra de Carax llevará la jóven Sempere a resucitar un pasado peligroso, una trama de amores desgraciados, odios y venganzas inmisericordes y verdades jamás desveladas, en la que asoman inquietantes similitudes con la propia existencia de Daniel. Equívocos recovecos llenos de las miserias de la guerra, amores truncados, fatalidad y muerte, donde la pasión por la literatura ejerce de mágico anfitrión.\n ",

And behold: the first truly realistic computer-generated creature with a character arc. Much credit goes to Serkis, whose reptilian body movements and hilariously pathetic voice infused the miserable miscreant with life?but props also to Jackson and his computer whizzes, who made us eager to watch Gollum?s every move and gasp at his deathly dance, which, finally, decides the fate of Middle-earth.\nDefining Moment: When we first see Gollum in all his twisted, tortured glory, in 2002?s The Two Towers, he is wrestling with himself over whether to betray the hobbits.

Nunca he comprendido ni uno sólo de los argumentos de los Creacionistas, y con este paisano me pasa exactamente lo mismo. Os dejo el texto original en la American Family Association porque se explica sólo.\n The president of a creation apologetics group says the dwarf skeleton of a supposedly primitive man recently found on an island in Indonesia may confound evolutionists, but it is easy for creationists to explain.\nAnswers in Genesis founder Dr. Ken Ham says he is always amazed by the reactions of evolutionists whenever a new, so-called \"humanoid\" bone is found. Inevitably, he says, the evolution proponents say with the finding of a new fossil that creationists have lost their age-old argument with Darwinists.\nBut Ham says this is not so. \"The interesting thing is that, really, from a creationist perspective, we have no trouble at all explaining variation within human kind like this,\" he explains. \"I like to help people understand that by saying, 'Look -- eight people got off Noah's Ark, and as they increased in number, and then you have the Tower of Babel, and you split up the human gene pool.'\"\nWhen this happens, the science expert continues, the result is \"different combinations of genes moving in different directions. You can get certain features in a particular group that might be unique to that particular group.\" Thus, he concludes, are the so-called \"evolutionary\" differences in the features of human skeletons explained.\nBut Ham says evolutionists are even arguing among themselves about whether the Indonesian skeletal remains found are even really those of a human. Meanwhile, he says creationists understand that there are some differences between modern man and the ancient skeleton, and that this is just another example of God's creativity in designing people.\nAlso, Ham says the skeleton was found with stone tools, suggesting some intelligence. But evolutionists' dating methods have caused problems here as well. He says the evolution scientists claim the dates range \"from 18,000 to 38,000 years, supposedly -- and of course that's assuming their dating methods are correct, which are all based on assumptions.\"\nThis creates a problem, the AIG spokesman says, \"because then they dated the stone tools at 800,000 years. So they say maybe the tools were used by somebody else, and then these particular humans came later -- or something like that.\"\nHam says evolutionists simply do not know what to do with this conflicting information. But he says these die-hard Darwinists will fit all their contradictory conclusions into their faulty evolutionary framework anyway.\n (Gracias BoingBoing)\n",

    "body": " Hablamos de la última película de Tim Burton, la última vuelta de tuerca de esta mente brillante, aunque en Big Fish comparte el mérito con los guionistas.\nEdward Bloom ha pasado su vida rodeado de muchísimos amigos encantados de escuchar sus historias. Para todo el mundo es adorable, menos para su propio hijo, que quiere saber la verdad sobre la vida de su padre. La vida los separa, pero vuelven a juntarse cuando la salud de Edward se complica. Su hijo Will aprovechará esos días para investigar cúanta verdad hay tras esos cuentos fantásticos.\nDesde el principio esta historia me ha recordado mucho a un cuento creado por Tolkien para consolar a su hijo Michael por la pérdida de un perrito de juguete. Roverandom es la historia de un perrito (llamado Rover) que es transformado en juguete por un mago y pasa por mil aventuras desde la Luna al fondo del mar con todo tipo de seres fantásticos. Un cuento encantador que finalmente fue publicado, aunque ese no fuera su objetivo inicial.\nTim Burton vuelve a rodar a su manera, cuidando todos los detalles, vigilando cada ángulo. No está tan marcado su estilo como en otras de sus obras, pero se deja notar. Sigue cumpliendo perfectamente y añadiendo ese extra que lo sitúa entre los genios de la profesión.\nHaga lo que haga, Ewan McGregor me sigue pareciendo Christian de Moulin Rouge, esa cara de entusiásmo la tiene desde que hizo esa película. El tipo es perfecto para dar vida a las fantasías del protagonista, le ves capaz de hacer esas locuras.\nJessica Lange y Albert Finney está muy bien, pero Billy Cudrup pasa toda la película con cara de mala leche, demasiado forzado. No lo hace mal. Que siga trabajando con buenos directores, a ver cómo progresa.\nImpagables las apariciones de Steve Buscemi (este tío me encanta) y Danny DeVito. Aunque ya sólo les den papeles secundarios, los tíos se ganan su importancia en cada toma.\nBuena historia, bien tratada y bien llevada. Le doy un ocho.\n",

    "body": " Acabo de ver la segunda parte de la saga de Mr Bourne, o como quiera que se llame este chico. Me gustó más la primera, pero El Mito de Bourne sigue siendo una buena peli de acción.\nJason Bourne vive escondido en una gran ciudad de la India. Hasta allí van a buscarle para acabar con él. No lo consiguen, y hacen que se enfade mucho. Les pidió tranquilidad y le responden con un matón. Por suerte todos creen que ha muerto, y le da margen para ir a buscarles allí donde estén. Mientras encaja su venganza, va descubriendo cosas sobre sí mismo y sobre Tredstone, su antigua organización.\nTiene persecuciones, pero no las típicas, tiene peleas, pero no las típicas, tiene historia de amor, pero no la típica. Tiene un gran error: la forma de rodar las escenas de acción de Paul Greengrass. Tampoco es una forma de rodar típica, es peor. Trasmite más mareo que otra cosa. En un primer visionado le he encontrado varios fallos de guión, varias cosas demasiado raras e incluso alguna incongruencia. Seguramente debido al poco detalle y la escasa calidad de los diálogos, que sí son típicos de peli mala americana.\nMatt Damon sigue cuadrando como un buen espia. El tipo parece impasible, y lleva bien los golpes que recibe, que en esta cinta son muchos. Quizá demasiado impasible, pero cumple bien con su trabajo.\nDe Franka Potente no puedo ni hablar.\nA Karl Urban le aconsejaría que se afeitase, con esa barba echo de menos la melena de Eomer. Frikadas aparte, es un buen tipo duro, pero me parecería triste que la que era gran esperanza del cine Neozelandés se quede en eso, en un tipo duro.\nAlgunas cosas raras, pero una cinta muy entretenida. El cine es entretenimiento, y esta película cumple su papel. Le doy un Seis.\n",

    "body": " Alguien voló sobre el Nido del Cuco, de Dale Wasserman  Anoche estuve en el Teatro de Móstoles viendo esta obra del grupo Réplika Teatro, que tienen su propia academia de actores, y con un gran reparto de gente jóven, curiosamente con algunas caras conocidas para mí (aunque aún no las ubico). Me encantó, tanto o más que la película de Milos Forman, que tendré que volver a ver necesariamente. El libro lo apunto entre mis pendientes.\nUna institución psiquiátrica recibe la visita de McMurphy, un nuevo paciente que llega hasta el centro para evitar una condena mayor en una penitenciaría. Poco a poco iremos conociendo al resto de los pacientes, y cómo McMurphy va entrando en sus corazones. La situación se vuelve dificil cuando se da cuenta que su libertad pasa por la autorización de la directora del centro, a la que cada día desafía. Gran final para esta obra, que ha destacado enormemente tanto en su versión de novela, cómo en el cine, con Jack Nicholson interpretando magníficamente al protagonista.\nAlgunas palabras del propio director, Jaroslaw Bielski:\n Conocemos 'Alguien voló sobre el nido del cuco' principalmente por la película de Milos Forman (con Jack Nicholson en el papel de McMurphy), inspirada en la novela que Ken Kesey escribió en 1962 y que también sirvió como base para la obra teatral de Dale Wasserman.\nLas tres producciones -novela, obra teatral y película- tratan sobre el mismo tema aunque, por motivos obvios desde diferente punto de vista formal. La novela se lee apasionadamente; la película ha conseguido un reconocimiento unánime; pero la obra teatral está construida de manera perfecta, y permite leer la historia de McMurphy como una corrosiva metáfora de la sociedad que pretende aislar, transformar y finalmente aniquilar a las personas cuya imaginación y razón son tan poderosas que hacen ignorar a los sentidos cuando éstos se enfrentan a ellas; personas que simplemente no quieren o no pueden aceptar el razonamiento de quien pretende anularlas con el abuso de poder.\nLa historia está contada por el Jefe Indio Bromden, que se hace pasar por sordomudo y que al final 'libera' a McMurphy de su vida vegetal. La obra teatral trascurre en un manicomio.\nEs una obra sobre la libertad, la que cada uno de los personajes busca huyendo del mundo externo, incluyendo al protagonista que huye de la cárcel. La buscan recurriendo a una institución. Una institución especializada en liberar al hombre de sus miedos y del poder que ejerce sobre ellos su imaginación.\nEl problema consiste en que el concepto de libertad buscado por los pacientes no tiene nada que ver con el de los que representan la 'sociedad libre': los enfermeros y los médicos. Y ahí es donde surge el conflicto de la obra, entre el individuo y la institución; ésta, como ente para proteger al individuo, y él como elemento que, luchando por su independencia, entra en conflicto con las reglas del juego impuestas. La tragedia surge cuando la institución decide sacrificar al individuo en nombre del 'bien común'.\nCuriosamente esta obra nunca se representó en España y ha sido traducida al castellano por vez primera en esta ocasión. Podemos hablar, entonces, de estreno absoluto de una obra cuya relevancia histórica y artística en la literatura dramática del siglo XX es indiscutible.\n ",

    "body": " Por fin he visto la última película de M Night Shyamalan, después de semanas de ver críticas y no poder leerlas, dada la tendencia de este tipo a los finales sorpresa, no quería poner en peligro el de The Village.\nY digo The Village, porque no entiendo mucho por qué aquí se ha llamado El Bosque. Tiene sentido, pero no el suficiente como para pasarse por el forro el título que en su momento eligió el autor de la obra. En casos parecidos suele tratarse de no poder elegir el título idóneo porque ya existía una película previa con ese nombre, pero no recuerdo ninguna película que se llamase La Aldea, o El Pueblo, o La Villa. Supongo que tendrá que ver con el afán de recalcar el miedo al Bosque, en lugar de la historia en sí. Me pregunto una cosa, ¿le piden al autor su autorización a la hora de asignar los títulos en otros idiomas?\nLa película es interesante. No me parece un gran film, ni me parece tan despreciable como a otros. He podido leer ahora la crítica de Pedro Jorge y no estoy de acuerdo en la mayoria de sus conclusiones, cuando normalmente comparto su visión de estas cosas.\nEl ritmo es muy bajo, este tipo parece no saber rodar de otra manera, pero acompaña bien al sentimiento de inmovilidad de la aldea. Y precisamente la historia se centra en el momento en que peligra esa quietud, tras una necesaria presentación de los personajes. Como siempre, la paz termina por motivos que estan fuera del alcance de los que planean todo esto. El Consejo elige a la ciega precisamente por ser eso, ciega, para preservar la misma existencia de la aldea. Es duro explicar estas cosas sin contar nada importante para los que no la han visto. No puedo destacar a ningún actor, quizá a la protagonista, Bryce Dallas Howard, que en esa mirada ciega dejaba ver gran intensidad, y a William Hurt por su siempre eficiente trabajo. Los supuestos pesos pesados Joaquin Phoenix (que sigue sin gustarme nada), Adrien Brody (¿cómo se metió en esto?) o Sigourney Weaver (que cambie de asesor) pasan bastante desapercibidos.\nQuizá algo previsible, pero no deja de parecerme un buen guión, no del todo bien tratado por el productor-guinista-director. Aunque sólo sea por la historia, siempre hay que agradecer que alguien aporte ideas a un mundillo en el que triunfa el guión fácil. Le doy un seis.\n",

Poco a poco descubrimos el cargamento, su importancia, y que más gente anda detrás de ese barco, por lo que se pueda encontrar tras siglos hundido y olvidado por todos. Todo ello mezclado con una dura historia de 'desamor' entre el viejo marinero, y una jóven que parece ocultar todo lo que sabe.\nLa Carta Esférica\nArturo Pérez Reverte\n[...] Tenía ganas de llorar al modo de cuando era niño, con lágrimas bien grandes y copiosas, incapaz de entibiar el escalofrío de tantas soledades.

Wheeler ha calculado que ese coste llegaría sin problemas a $612M (490 Millones de Euros). Todo a raíz de un tipo que ofreció $50k (40 Mil Euros) para que se cambiara la licencia GPL de Linux por una más permisiva del tipo BSD. Podemos ver las cuentas de David Wheeler:\n MM-nominal-semidetached = 3*(KSLOC)^1.12 = 3* (4287.449)^1.12 = 35,090 MM Effort-adjustment = 1.15 * 1.0 * 1.65 * 1.11 * 1.0 * 1.15 * 1.0 * 0.86 * 1.0 * 0.86 * 1.0 * 0.95 * 0.91 * 1.0 * 1.0 = 1.54869 MM-adjusted = 35,090 * 1.54869 = 54,343.6 Man-Months = 4,528.6 Man-years of effort to (re)develop If average salary = $56,286/year, and overhead = 2.40, then: Development cost = 56286*2.4*4528.6 = $611,757,037 In short, it would actually cost about $612 million (US) to re-develop the Linux kernel.

La gran utilidad de esta página, ya que según vas viendo las películas, éstas van desapareciendo de la lista, dejando paso a otras. Para que os hagáis una idea, el ranking actual de las (aproximadamente) 30 películas que debo ver que no he valorado por no haber visto (o las vi hace demasiado) viene encabezado por:\n Vértigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958)\n Cantando Bajo la Lluvia (Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly, 1952)\n El Hombre Tranquilo (John Ford, 1952)\n Metrópolis (Fritz Lang, 1927)\n La Noche del Cazador (Charles Laughton, 1955)  Hoy he visto una de las que estaban en los primeros puestos, y que llevaba tiempo con ganas de volver a ver. Ahora tengo el tiempo suficiente para estas pelis de casi cuatro horas. Aunque supongo que todos la habréis visto, seguiré mi costumbre de no destripar nada, por si la visteis hace mucho o ni siquiera eso.\nHace unos días ví Cold Mountain, igualmente ambientada en la Guerra Civil Americana. Mis oídos han escuchado estos días la frase 'maldito yankee' más que los de cualquier iraquí. Son dos visiones distintas, en dos lugares distintos, de la sangrienta historia americana.\nEn Tara, una gran finca en Georgia, vive Escarlata O'Hara, y trae locos a todos los jovenes de la región. Sin embargo ella ama a Ashley, que está enamorado y prometido de Melanie. Estalla la guerra, y todos los hombres deben abandonar sus casas para luchar. En su despedida de Ashley, Escarlata conoce al capitán Rhett Butler, que desde entonces marcará su vida.\nVictor Fleming empezó a apuntar alto con esta gran película. Hizo después otras dos grandes (El Mago de Oz y El Extraño Caso del Dr Jeckyll), pero luego no tuvo continuidad. Pese al fenomenal guión y al gran reparto, no le resto meritos. La película tiene ritmo, y pese a las casi cuatro horas que dura, no aburre. La fotografía es mejorable, pero deja escenas para el recuerdo.\nEl centro de la película es Vivien Leigh, en todo su sentido. Sólo con la mirada conquista y maneja a su antojo toda Georgia... y al espectador. Mejor no comparamos con Nicole Kidman, no sería justo, aunque ambos personajes viven situaciones semejantes.\nClark Gable hace su gran papel, parece que ha nacido para él. Tiene ese gesto pícaro y embaucador que le viene al pelo para ser un incomparable Capitán Butler.\nOlivia de Havilland está genial. Da la impresión de ser tan buena y amable como el personaje que interpreta. Sólo tiene una pega, y no es suya. La actriz que dobla a Olivia en esta película hace que parezca estupida. Prefiero no saber su nombre, porque cada vez que escucho su voz en una peli me tiro de los pelos. No trasmite ningún tipo de emoción y tiene además una voz demasiado peculiar (para mi gusto) para doblar cine.\nNo me ha gustado nada Leslie Howard. Convierte un personaje importante, casi en un estorbo. En algunas escenas deseaba que no abriese la boca. Quizá por eso luego no tuvo trascendencia en el cine, tras una película que marcó a todos los demás.\nImpresionante Hattie McDaniel como Mammy. Su \"Señorita Escarlaaata\" es Historia del Cine.\nOs pongo los enlaces a Culturalia, en lugar de a Film Affinity. Creo que tienen la base de Datos más completa, pero prefiero los comentarios de FA. ¿Qué pensáis?\nGran película con un gran reparto. Todo grande. Le daré un diez.\n",

Agradezco mucho que una película tenga acción, pero detrás una gran historia. Esta historia lo es. Anthony Minghella vuelve a conmover por momentos, pero sigue sin dar el suficiente ritmo.

Yo no le veo llegar tan alto, es un buen actor, pero le falta carisma, le falta enamorar a la cámara y al espectador. Acerca de su papel en esta película, el pobre pasa todo tipo de penurias, sabe sufrir en pantalla. Quizá sufra demasiado, creo que Vassili Zaitsev (su personaje en Enemigo a las Puertas, 2000) le daría tres guantazos si le viese quejarse tanto.\nNicole Kidman me gustó bastante. Bellísima como siempre, trasmite energía en cada toma. Incluso estando desolada, parece que va a dar un puñetazo en la mesa en cualquier momento.\nRenée Zellweger sigue sin decirme nada.

Mientras pasa los días escribiendo y soñando con volar fuera de su habitación, busca la forma de quitarse la vida si no se lo permiten los jueces.\nNo le es favorable el dictamen judicial, y la historia de Ramón termina con su suicidio asistido, pero a escondidas, a pesar de sus intentos de que la sociedad acepte y entienda situaciones como la suya.\nRespecto a la película de Alejandro Amenábar, son dos horas de pura poesía. Un enorme Javier Bardem muy bien acompañado por el resto de los actores. Quizá demasiada carga 'sbrexual' y a mi me sobró parte del alivio cómico, pero ignoro por completo la biografía real del personaje en ese sentido.\nSólo tengo una pega. La caracterización de Ramón es magnífica, pero (aunque tendría que volver a verla) me dió la impresión de que la cantidad (o calidad) del maquillaje de Bardem decrecía mucho según avanzaba la película. Me pareció que en algunas escenas apenas llevaba, y era el Javier Bardem de toda la vida, con una simple peluca.\nDe las grandes bandas sonoras que Amenábar ha creado hasta ahora, esta quizá sea mi favorita. Sólo con oirla te transportas fácilmente a cualquier rincón de Galicia. Se me llena la boca de sabor a vino Corales (es algo personal) y pulpo.\nEl camino de vuelta en el coche al salir del cine de madrugada fue en completo silencio. Aún se me pone la piel de gallina cuando escucho estas estrofas.\n Mar adentro, mar adentro. Y en la ingravidez del fondo donde se cumplen los sueños se juntan dos voluntades para cumplir un deseo. Un beso enciende la vida con un relámpago y un trueno y en una metamorfosis mi cuerpo no es ya mi cuerpo, es como penetrar al centro del universo. El abrazo más pueril y el más puro de los besos hasta vernos reducidos en un único deseo. Tu mirada y mi mirada como un eco repitiendo, sin palabras 'más adentro', 'más adentro' hasta el más allá del todo por la sangre y por los huesos. Pero me despierto siempre y siempre quiero estar muerto, para seguir con mi boca enredada en tus cabellos  ",

Tan simpático como siempre, dijo a la prensa:\n I am really bummed I missed the convention on Sunday but this made up for it. I'll remember it every time I walk by his star. Safe journeys Scotty...\n Se refiere a una convención muy especial para él, The James Doohan Farewell Star Trek Convention \u0026amp; Tribute que se acaba de celebrar del 27 al 30 de Agosto en el Hotel Renaissance de Hollywood. Parece que está recibiendo todos los honores posibles. Sin duda son merecidos, pero lamentablemente suelen ser señal de un mal estado de salud.\nEn este enlace (saltad la publicidad) hay más fotos del acto de entrega de su estrella, en las que se ve a Scotty con otros míticos actores de la serie: Walter Koenig, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols,...\nCon la gran noticia, otra más curiosa. Sigue haciendo falta aportar 15.000 dolares (por mucha fama que uno tenga) para poder tan sólo optar a que la Cámara de Comercio de Hollywood se reúna para votar si aprueban la concesión de la estrella.\nVeo a este hombre y, sobretodo, lo mayor que está y me doy cuenta del tiempo que ha pasado desde que empecé en esto de la ciencia ficción y el frikismo en general.\n Live Long and Prosper, Scotty  (Enlace via BoingBoing)\n",

No se qué será pero a mi me sigue fallando algo. El libro tiene partes muy buenas, pero tiene muchas otras que son lamentables, especialmente en la segunda mitad del libro. Hay quien lo justifica con que es un libro para niños y jóvenes, pero a mi esas partes me parecían igual de lamentables cuando lo leí con 12 o 17 años. Ves que la historia no avanza, que Bastian se va encontrando gente, que le van pasando cosas, que no aportan nada a la trama. Siempre me ha parecido que Michael Ende tenía una serie de mini-relatos en la cabeza y los quiso meter como fuese en una novela.\nA veces siento que Wolfgang Petersen aún comiéndose medio libro en su película, mantuvo intacta la trama.\nDe cualquier forma, el libro está repleto de detalles deliciosos que lo convierten en lectura obligada, para niños, jóvenes, o para cualquier adulto que aún no lo haya leído.\n",

Es un aviso necesario, porque de todo ello depende que te pueda gustar o no Fahrenheit 9/11.\nEn algo menos de dos horas, empieza discutiendo el simple hecho de que George W. Bush sea presidente de los EEUU, y acaba poniendo en duda la labor de las tropas en Irak, pasando por las relaciones de las familias Bin Laden y Bush, o la necesidad de arrasar Afganistán.\nAl contrario que en Bowling for Columbine aquí no se dice nada nuevo. Al menos nada nuevo para alguien moderadamente informado. Bien es cierto que algunas de las informaciones no son nuevas porque él mismo las ha expuesto por otros medios. Pero eso sí, este tío lo cuenta muy bien.\nFahrenheit 9/11 es un curso avanzado de propaganda, como hace mucho que no se veía. No sentía una sensación parecida de manipulación desde hace tiempo. Pero aquí lo sabes, vas al cine consciente de que vas a ver un buen montón de medias verdades, exageraciones o insinuaciones sin crédito alguno. Esto tiene una doble consecuencia, te puedes partir de risa durante casi dos horas (como yo), o te puedes sentir tremendamente indignado minuto a minuto.\nPero el fondo de lo que se cuenta es cierto, y lo vemos a diario en los medios. El Sr. Bush es tremendamente estúpido, hubo bastante mamoneo alrededor del Once de Septiembre y la crisis de Afganistán, y ahora hay toneladas de mamoneo acerca de la guerra de Irak. Maravilla cómo un tipo así puede llegar tan alto (no hablaré de su poder, porque soy de los que opinan que tiene bastante poco), y cómo puede la gente hacer oídos sordos ante tantas cosas.\nMe conformo con que esta película le abra los ojos a alguien, le haga dudar (o le aclare las dudas), o le provoque para que investigue por su cuenta todo esto que aquí se muestra. Aunque minimamente, ayudará a que John Kerry gane las próximas elecciones. O lo realmente importante, que G.W. Bush las pierda.\nAparte de todas estas consecuencias positivas a nivel mundial, a mi me hizo pasar un muy buen rato.\n",

Se trataba de la última película del director mejicano Alejandro González Iñaritu, que ya me dejó helado con Amores Perros. Gracias al incremento de presupuesto, esta vez todo está mucho más cuidado, todo está hecho mucho más despacio, aunque las dos películas tienen un toque personal inconfundible.\nTras un inicio desconcertante, poco a poco te mete en el propio guión, tratando de adivinar lo siguiente, esperando que pase, deseando que no pase, temiendo que se vea. Sean Penn y Benicio del Toro están espectaculares, aunque yo destacaría, por sorprendente, a Naomi Watts. Tiene la mirada perdida perfecta y se mete al personaje de Sean Penn en el bolsillo varias veces. No contaré mucho más para no restarle interés a la cinta.\nPelícula altamente recomendable, preferiblemente sin tener ni idea del argumento, como era mi caso, para poder ir captando todos los detalles que el director nos lanza desde la primera escena hasta la última.\n",

    "body": " Richard M. Stallman  Entre ayer y hoy he asistido, como os anuncié, a dos conferencias de Richard Stallman, uno de las pocas personas a las que puedo considerar mis ídolos. Por su personalidad, por su trabajo en estos más de veinte últimos años pero sobre todo por su dedicación a todo lo que hace.\nEsto sólo pretende ser una mala crónica de todo lo que ha dicho. Y digo mala porque no tomé notas ni nada, siempre necesario para relatar algo con un mínimo de fidelidad, olvidaré comentar el 90 % de lo que se dijo, y el 10 % que comento lo hare por encima.\nThe Free Software Movement and GNU/Linux (4 de Mayo de 2004) Nada nuevo en esta conferencia sobre temas que algunos ya hemos visto, oído o leído varias veces. No por ello menos memorable. Mr Stallman lleva años dedicandose a dar conferencias, y esta en concreto es de las más repetidas, con lo que sabe explicarse a la perfección, a pesar de su peculiar (aunque impecable) castellano y su cansancio, que le obligó a dar la conferencia en pie porque \"si me siento, dormiré\".\nNos contó los conocidos inicios del movimiento GNU en los años 80, la filosofía de la Fundación del Software Libre, el significado y uso de la licencia GPL, la putada que se avecina con las Patentes de Software si no hacemos nada, etc. Como ejemplo, expondré sus ya famosas cuatro libertades necesarias del software.\n \"Libertad de uso, libertad para el usuario\". El usuario debe ser capaz de usar el programa bajo cualquier circunstancia, sin clausulas o condiciones. \"La libertad de ayudarse a sí mismo\" modificando el programa si no funciona bien, o si le faltan funcionalidades que uno necesita. No tiene que ser el propio usuario el que modifique el programa, puede contratarlo. \"La libertad de ayudar a los demás\" dándoles los programas que necesitan. La libertad de distribuir no sólo el programa original, sino también las modificaciones que uno ha realizado, formando una comunidad de usuarios que mejoren el software que usan.  La conferencia fue muy divertida, me reí como hacía tiempo que no lo hacía. Hizo el ya famoso número del disfraz de santo con la aureola, que se puso después de sacarlo de una bolsa. \"Muchos me preguntan si lo que tengo en la cabeza es un disco duro de ordenador, y les digo que no. Bueno, en una vida anterior lo fue, pero ahora es mi aureola\". Impresionante. \"Yo soy santo de la Iglesia del Software Libre, si queréis serlo también, y no exigimos celibato, sólo debéis usar GNU Linux en todos los ordenadores que están bajo vuestro mando directo\".\nPara que seguir, algunos os sabéis todo esto mejor que yo (el resto a qué esperáis).\nCopyright vs Community (5 de Mayo de 2004) La conferencia de esta mañana, mucho más seria y más focalizada que la de ayer. Ha comentado todos los problemas existentes acerca de las patentes, de la industria musical, y de las grandes editoriales. Como aspecto muy positivo de la charla, ha dado soluciones a bastantes de estos problemas. Aquí es donde más en falta he echado no haber tomado notas, porque ha sido realmente muy interesante.\nY a la salida de la charla (que terminó tras una larga ronda de preguntas porque Mr Stallman tuvo que salir corriendo al servicio) he podido acercarme y hacerme una foto con él (Jodete de envidia Jose).\nHe colgado las demás fotos en calidad enorme, bajadlas rápido porque la semana que viene las quitaré o al menos las pondré en calidad media-baja.\n",

Ya le he escuchado otras veces, y siempre merece la pena. ¿Os animás a venir?\nThe Free Software Movement and GNU/Linux\nMartes 4 de Mayo (10:30 a.m) Richard Stallman hablará (en castellano) de las metas y de la filosofía del Movimiento de Software Libre, así como del estatus y la historia del sistema operativo GNU, el cual, junto con el kernel de Linux, es usado en la actualidad por millones de usuarios en el mundo entero.\nCopyright vs Community\nMiércoles 5 de Mayo (10:30 a.m.) Richard Stallman hablará (en castellano) acerca de los derechos de “Copyright”, y de cómo este sistema no se ajusta bien a la nueva sociedad de compartición de información creada gracias a las redes de computadoras. Solamente la amenaza constante de sanciones draconianas a los usuarios puede hacerlo cumplir.\nMientras las empresas editoras que se benefician del “Copyright”, alientan estas draconianas sanciones e incrementan sus poderes de “Copyright”, se suprime el acceso público a la tecnología. Si de verdad se espera servir al legítimo propósito del “Copyright”, que era Promover el Progreso por el beneficio del público”, entonces debemos hacer cambios hacia otra dirección.\n",

    "body": " Sean Michael Palmer acting as Munkustrap - Photo Credit: Michael Benedict  Ha pasado mucho tiempo desde que fui a ver Cats. No debí dejar pasar tanto porque no recuerdo algunas de las cosas que quería comentar. Bueno, empezamos.\nAsí como El Fantasma de la Opera me parece una gran obra, pero no me pareció una gran adaptación, en el caso de Cats no tengo dudas. El Musical de Cats no me gustó. El argumento me parece malo, no encontré ni una gran canción, y sólo puede entenderse cómo una gran obra desde el punto de vista estético o visual. No imagino cual es el motivo para que tenga tantos records de permanencia en Londres o Broadway.\nSi no es por el folleto que te venden (creo que 0,50 €) al entrar, no habría entendido en absoluto el argumento. Os cuento por encima:\nEn las primeras canciones nos dicen que los gatos jélicos se reunen para celebrar una fiesta anual. Después vienen seis canciones para presentarnos algunos personajes. Estas presentaciones no importan mucho (o nada) para la historia. Entran en escena otros gatos que no sabemos de donde salen y hay una pelea. Después del descanso siguen las presentaciones. Los secuaces del gato malo secuestran al lider de los buenos, pero el gato mago trae de vuelta al lider con un hechizo. Todo acaba cuando el gato lider elige a uno de los gatos para que renazca.\nAsi puede sonar muy bonito, pero en realidad es diez minutos de argumento, una hora de canciones que no aportan nada a la historia, otros diez minutos con interés, otra hora de canciones, y veinte minutos de interés.\nAdemás al día siguiente vi la obra original en divx. Es exactamente igual, calcados los bailes, los trajes, casi hasta las canciones, que son simples traducicones directas. Eso no tiene mérito y obviamente me gustó más la obra original, pero con los mismos problemas.\nResumen - Os recomiendo que vayáis si tenéis mucho interés. La escenografía es bestial y las coreografías son buenas. Pero el argumento es malo y el interés escaso.\nLo mejor - La compañía ;-)\n",
